# AetherSDR — Project Context for AI Agents

This is the canonical project guide for any AI assistant working on
AetherSDR — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini
Code Assist, Aider, AetherClaude (our orchestrator bot), or any other
tool. Several of those tools look for their own well-known file at a
different path (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
`GEMINI.md`); those are thin pointers back here, and a tool without one
reads this file directly. Everything project-wide lives in
**this** file.

If you are an AI assistant: read this file end-to-end before writing
code or recommending merges. The file is ~1150 lines; that is the cost
of doing the job right on this codebase.

**This file is documentation, not policy.** It describes how to build
AetherSDR — architecture, conventions, build steps, protocol notes. The
rules that bind you live in [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md) and
[`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md), and they outrank everything here. Where
this file appears to contradict either, they win, and the contradiction is
a defect in this file — fix it or open an issue. That separation is what
puts this file at CODEOWNERS Tier 2 (infrastructure) while the Constitution
and GOVERNANCE.md stay Tier 1 (maintainer-only): editing build conventions
is not a governance act and should not need a maintainer's approval.

One passage restates policy rather than describing practice:
§"Autonomous Agent Boundaries" below elaborates the autonomy limits that
[`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md) §AI Contributors defines. It may narrow or
illustrate them, never widen them — relaxing any of those bullets is an
amendment to GOVERNANCE.md and cannot be made in a Tier-2 PR.

## Project Goal

Replicate the **Windows-only FlexRadio SmartSDR client** (written in C#) as a
**native, cross-platform C++ application** using Qt6 and C++20. The aim is to mirror the
look, feel, and every function SmartSDR is capable of. The reference radio is a
**FLEX-8600 running firmware 4.2.18**, which speaks **SmartSDR protocol v1.4.0.0**.

## AI Agent Guidelines

> **TEMPORARY — read before opening any PR that touches `src/core/backends/`,
> `RadioModel`, `RadioSession`, `TransmitModel`, `ConnectionPanel`, discovery,
> or `RadioCapabilities`.** The 2026-09-10 backend architecture review is
> tracked in **#5554** (meta: every open seam/multi-radio issue plus the new

> item listed there — no new `usesFlexCommandPlane()` / family-string
> branches, no new raw Flex wire text above the seam, no new `dynamic_cast`
> to a concrete backend, no new capability declared without a verb behind
> it, no copy of HL2 scaffolding into another host-DSP family, and no new
> keying-class verb that skips the TX gate in `RadioModel`. If your PR
> resolves one of those items, link it. This notice is removed when #5554's
> §2 items each have their own issue and #5262 M1 has landed.

When helping with AetherSDR:
- Prefer C++20 / Qt6 idioms (std::ranges, concepts if clean, Qt signals/slots over lambdas when possible)
- Keep classes small and single-responsibility
- Use RAII everywhere (no naked new/delete)
- Comment non-obvious protocol decisions with firmware version
- When suggesting code: show **diff-style** changes or full function/class if small
- Test suggestions locally if possible — the build must work on Linux, macOS and Windows
- Never suggest Wine/Crossover workarounds — goal is native
- Flag any proposal that would break slice 0 RX flow
- If unsure about protocol behavior → ask for logs/wireshark captures first
- **Use `AppSettings`, never `QSettings`** — see "Settings Persistence" below
- **New engine code goes in `libaethercore`** (`src/core/` or `src/models/`),
  exposed to the UI through models — never via a new gui→core header include.
  See "Build targets" and "In-flight: aetherd" under Architecture Overview.
- **Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`** for contribution policy (what we accept, who
  reviews what) and `docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` for the contributor-facing
  coding conventions and the AI-to-AI debugging protocol (open a GitHub issue
  for cross-agent coordination)
- **Gating a control on a radio capability? Dim it, never hide it.** Individual controls render in one of three states — unavailable (the radio lacks it, dimmed **with a stated reason**), inactive (supported, not engaged), active. Hiding survives only at applet granularity for a cohesive radio-specific cluster. Register with `ControlAvailabilityRegistry` rather than writing another `setVisible()`; the reason must reach a screen reader via `accessibleDescription` (widgets) or `statusTip` (`QAction`s), because a tooltip is a mouse affordance that is never announced. `tools/check_a11y.py` warns on a disabled control whose reason lives only in a tooltip. Doctrine: [`docs/style/theme-style-guide.md`](docs/style/theme-style-guide.md) §"Three-state controls" (#5262 M3a, #4896).
- **Adding or changing UI? Read [`docs/style/theme-style-guide.md`](docs/style/theme-style-guide.md) first** — every colour resolves through a ThemeManager token (error/warning/success/notification/TX all have one); never hardcode a colour literal. CI's hardcoded-colour ratchet fails a PR that raises the count above its base branch.
- **Sign every commit you author.** `main` enforces `required_signatures`, so a
  PR with unsigned commits cannot merge without an admin override. If the
  contributor has not set up commit signing yet, walk them through
  `docs/COMMIT-SIGNING.md` **before** you commit — the top of that file is a
  step-by-step AI-assistant algorithm covering Windows / macOS / Linux / WSL /
  Raspberry Pi. Default to SSH signing; GPG is the fallback for existing GPG
  workflows. Verify with `git log --show-signature -1` after the first commit.
- **Read the AetherSDR Constitution before writing or reviewing code.**
  Canonical source: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Byte-identical
  mirror at `CONSTITUTION.md` in repo root for discoverability. 14
  principles total (constitution v2.0.0): 7 AetherSDR-domain governance
  principles (FlexLib authority, radio-authoritative live state,
  radio-persistable settings, clean-room contributions, per-feature
  config ownership, transmit-on-intent, boundary input validation) + 7
  defensive engineering principles adopted from Cisco's
  [Foundry Constitution](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/foundry-security-spec/blob/main/constitution.md)
  (Evidence Over Assertion, Surface Only What Survives, Claims Are
  Atomic And Mortal, Fixes Are Demonstrated, Sandbox By Infrastructure,
  Operator Outranks Every Agent, Persist Atomically). The defensive
  set codifies how AetherSDR's multi-agent contribution model (≥6
  distinct AI tools touching the codebase) avoids the failure modes
  of confident-but-wrong AI changes, stale-snapshot reverts, and
  prompt-injection escalation. Commit messages cite the most-load-bearing
  principle as `Principle <N>.` at the end of the subject line.

### Issue / PR Claim Protocol — Assign Yourself

When an AI agent is **actively reviewing an issue or PR — for comment,
for merge recommendation, or to implement a fix** — the agent MUST
assign itself to the issue or PR using GitHub's `assignees` feature
**before** posting the review, comment, or merge action.

This is the visible claim mechanism for multi-agent contribution
coordination (Principle X: Claims Are Atomic And Mortal). The
`aetherclaude-eligible` label gates implementation work; the
assignees list signals "an agent is actively engaged on this right
now" to every other agent and to the maintainer.

**Concrete rules**:

1. **Before** posting a review, comment, or merge action: check the
   current assignees. Then:
   - **Unassigned, or assigned ONLY to AetherClaude
     (`@aethersdr-agent`)**: add yourself alongside.
     **AetherClaude auto-triages every new issue and every new
     PR**, so its assignment is the persistent triage-engagement
     signal, NOT a claim on active merge work. Adding yourself
     alongside AetherClaude is expected and correct.
   - **Already assigned to another human agent or AI agent**
     (not AetherClaude): leave a coordination comment instead of
     double-assigning, and do not proceed with overlapping work.
2. **While** working: stay assigned. Other agents will see the
   non-AetherClaude assignment and route around you.
3. **After** posting the comment / completing the review / merging:
   the assignment can stay. GitHub auto-clears assignees when an
   issue closes or a PR merges. Manual unassign is optional but
   appropriate when you've concluded but the issue/PR remains open
   (e.g., you reviewed and recommended merge but didn't merge
   yourself).
4. **If your work is interrupted** (token limit, context loss,
   model failure): leave a brief comment ("Stepping away;
   unassigning so another agent can pick up") and unassign. The
   claim is mortal — it dies with the agent that held it
   (Principle X). AetherClaude's assignment is separate and stays.
5. **Quick read-only actions don't require assignment**: pulling an
   issue's title to summarize, listing PRs in a status report,
   counting open issues. Assignment is for engagement that produces
   a comment, review, or merge.

**GitHub CLI command**:

```bash
# Assign yourself to issue NNNN or PR NNNN
gh issue edit NNNN --add-assignee @me
gh pr edit NNNN --add-assignee @me

# Unassign yourself
gh issue edit NNNN --remove-assignee @me
gh pr edit NNNN --remove-assignee @me

# Check current assignees
gh issue view NNNN --json assignees
gh pr view NNNN --json assignees
```

**Why this exists**: without a visible claim signal, two agents
working from different orchestrators or contributor IDEs can both
spend tokens reviewing the same PR, post conflicting recommendations
within minutes of each other, and waste the maintainer's review time
reconciling them. The assignees list is the cheap, persistent,
multi-agent-visible claim mechanism that prevents this. It is the
operational implementation of Principle X.

### Autonomous Agent Boundaries

> **Authority: [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md) §AI Contributors.** That
> section defines these limits and is Tier 1 (maintainer-only). What follows
> is the worked-example elaboration for agent consumption — it may narrow or
> illustrate the limits, never widen them. If this list and GOVERNANCE.md
> differ, GOVERNANCE.md governs and the difference is a defect here. Do not
> relax any bullet below in a Tier-2 PR; that is an amendment to GOVERNANCE.md.

AI agents (including AetherClaude/pi-claude) may autonomously fix:
- **Bugs with clear root cause** — persistence missing, guard missing, crash fix
- **Protocol compliance** — matching SmartSDR behavior confirmed by pcap/FlexLib
- **Build/CI fixes** — missing dependencies, platform compat

AI agents must **NOT** autonomously change:
- **Visual design** — colors, fonts, layout, theme (user preferences ≠ project direction)
- **UX behavior** — how controls work, what clicks do, keyboard shortcuts
- **Architecture** — adding new threads, changing signal routing, new dependencies
- **Feature scope** — adding features beyond what the issue describes
- **Default values** — changing defaults that affect all users based on one report

When in doubt, the agent should implement the fix and note in the PR that
design decisions need maintainer review. The project maintainer (Jeremy/KK7GWY)
is the sole authority on visual design and UX direction.

## C++ Style Guide

- **No `goto`** — use early returns, break, or restructure the logic
- **No raw `new`/`delete`** — use `std::unique_ptr`, `std::make_unique`, or Qt parent ownership
- **No `#define` macros for constants** — use `constexpr` or `static constexpr`
- **Braces on all control flow** — even single-line `if`/`else`/`for`/`while`
- **`auto` sparingly** — use explicit types unless the type is obvious from context (e.g. `auto* ptr = new Foo` is fine, `auto x = foo()` is not)
- **Naming**: classes `PascalCase`, methods/variables `camelCase`, constants `kPascalCase`, member variables `m_camelCase`
- **Platform guards**: prefer `Q_OS_WIN` / `Q_OS_MAC` / `Q_OS_LINUX` for new code. Existing `_WIN32`/`__APPLE__` guards can be migrated opportunistically — don't do a blanket rewrite.
- **Don't remove code you didn't add** — if rebasing, ensure upstream changes are preserved. Review the diff before submitting.
- **Atomic parameters for cross-thread DSP** — main thread writes via `std::atomic`, audio thread reads. Never hold a mutex in the audio callback for parameter updates.
- **Error handling**: log with `qCWarning(lcCategory)`, don't throw exceptions

## Build

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build --parallel
./build/AetherSDR          # Windows: build\AetherSDR.exe
```

**Optional — DFNR (DeepFilterNet3) noise reduction.** Run
`scripts/setup/setup-deepfilter.sh` (Windows: `setup-deepfilter.ps1`)
*once before* `cmake` to fetch the prebuilt `libdeepfilter` for your
platform; configure will otherwise report `DFNR ... disabled — library
not found` and gate the feature off. CI runs this step automatically
(cached) in the release-build workflows, so shipped binaries always
include DFNR; it is a manual prereq only for local dev builds. NR still
works without it — RN2 (RNNoise) is bundled and always built, needing no
setup.

**RNNoise architecture check.** The `third_party/rnnoise/src/x86` sources and
include directory belong only in x86 build graphs. After configuring any ARM
build, `rg 'rnnoise/src/x86' <build-dir>/build.ninja` must find no matches.

Full dependency list is in `README.md` — don't duplicate it here.

### Adding a test — declare it in `tests/tests.cmake`, not `CMakeLists.txt`

Drop `<feature>_test.cpp` into `tests/`, then declare its `add_executable` +
`add_test` in **`tests/tests.cmake`**. There is no glob; every test is declared
explicitly, so copy a neighbouring target's block.

These all lived in the root `CMakeLists.txt` before the split, so a stale doc,
an old PR, or pattern-matching on the surrounding code will all point you at
the wrong file. Two guards catch that: `tests.cmake`
aborts the CMake configure step, and `tools/check_test_registration.py --strict`
fails the PR in CI.

Paths in `tests.cmake` are relative to the **repository root**
(`tests/foo_test.cpp`, `src/gui/Bar.cpp`) because it is pulled in with
`include()`, not `add_subdirectory()`. Do not convert it to a subdirectory to
"tidy it up": `include()` keeps the root's directory scope, which is what keeps
those paths — and ten `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}` references pointing at
`tools/` and `docs/` — resolving correctly. Under `add_subdirectory` the source
paths fail loudly and those ten fail *silently*. The file's header says all of
this at the point of use.

A test that touches `AppSettings` also needs its target name in the
`AETHER_SETTINGS_CONSUMERS` list at the bottom of `tests.cmake`.

**Do not add a `ctest -R` step for it to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.** The
per-PR gate there is a frozen allow-list (`.github/ci-test-gate.txt`) of
tests kept on the macOS and Windows jobs because the claim each pins is about
that platform's toolchain (Apple Metal, MSVC portability); the Linux job runs
no tests at all, and the list does not grow. Every test declared in
`tests.cmake` that the default configure builds runs unfiltered in two places
from the moment it is declared: on every push to `main` (`full-suite.yml`,
minutes after the merge) and again weekly under the sanitizers
(`sanitizers.yml`). That is where a new test runs. (A test behind a
default-OFF option runs in neither unless that lane passes the option; say so
in the PR.) `tools/check_ci_test_gate.py` runs in `Static checks` and fails
the PR if a `-R` pattern in a pull-request workflow resolves to a name the
frozen list does not carry. Removing a test from the gate is fine:
run the script with `--update` and commit the shorter list. The script only
ever shrinks the list; growing it is a hand edit to the maintainer-owned
file, with the reason in the PR body. See "Gate integrity" below.

Every unconditional `add_executable(<name>_test …)` must have a matching
`add_test`, or carry a `# not registered: <reason>` marker the registration
checker recognizes (option-gated and manual targets qualify). A test that
compiles but is never registered reads as coverage while running in no job —
`issue_report_test`, the GHSA-ccrg-j8cp-qhc4 regression guard, has run in no
job from its creation to this day (#5101, still open, registers it). This
becomes checked once the `check_test_registration.py` extension from #5254
lands; until then it is convention.

A test for a fixed bug should be mutation-checked before the PR goes up:
break the guard on purpose, watch the test fail, restore it, and say so in
the PR body.

### Test-layer boundary — where an assertion lives

Decide the layer before writing the test (#5232):

| The assertion proves | It lives in |
|---|---|
| Wire encoding, parser bounds, model tables, scheduling, DSP, capability/safety policy | a socket-free CTest in `tests/`, grounded in the official guide or gateware |
| A refusal, a non-event, a dropped/malformed/disconnected input, a TX guard | a socket-free test that **injects the transport** — feed the frame handler or state machine directly; no `QTcpServer`/`QUdpSocket`, no peer process |
| A race or lifetime bug under churn | the sanitizer lane (`sanitizers.yml`) — the sanitizer is the point |
| The app converges with real firmware (session, RX, controls, meter liveness) | the automation bridge + `radiocert` on live hardware. Positive effects only: radiocert is a diagnostic, not pass/fail, and cannot prove an isolated non-event |
| A closed loop that needs a simulator peer (hpsdrsim TX) | an explicit opt-in target, never registered by default |

**No new synthetic peer standing in for third-party radio or amplifier
firmware enters the default graph.** A fake radio proves the client agrees
with our model of the radio, not with the radio; the model freezes while
firmware moves, so the test fails on correct changes or stays green on real
divergence (#5232). Four legacy exceptions remain in
the default graph, all tracked for socket-free extraction in #5254:
`vkamp_connection_test` (fake VKAMP amplifier), `hl2_receiver_count_restart_test`
(fake Metis radio), `gui_client_registration_recovery_test` (fake FLEX-6700
handshake peer), and `thumbdv_queue_test` (a pty-backed fake DV3000 dongle —
not a socket, which is why it went unenumerated; #5405 review). Mining a retired fake peer's frame tables as
*input data* for injected-transport tests is encouraged; running the fake as
a live socket peer is not. Loopback mocks of documented HTTP APIs are a
different trade — that contract is versioned and published; radio firmware
behavior is not.

Socket tests where **our own server is the subject** (rigctld, CAT, the TCI
server, the automation bridge's transport) remain legitimate: the code under
test is real, the socket is how you reach it. The carve-out exempts a test
from the fake-firmware ban, not from visibility: any new socket-owning test
is disclosed in the PR body, its `tests.cmake` block names the socket it
binds, reviewers notify the operator before continuing, and the test fails
fast (or skips, exit 77) when it cannot bind rather than consuming its
timeout.

Prefer behavioral seams over source-text assertions: a test that greps a
source file for an expression breaks on behavior-preserving refactors and
gets deleted by whoever it fires on. Applets already link into unit tests,
so the seam is a `tests.cmake` entry, not a missing capability.

### Version and release files

Current version: **26.9.5**.
Versioning scheme is **CalVer** (`YY.M.patch[.hotfix]`) starting from v26.5.1,
the 1.0-equivalent. Hotfix sub-patches use a 4th component (e.g. 26.5.2.1).
Earlier tags used semver through v0.9.8.

The version is stated in **five** places, and a release is not prepped until
all five agree — check every row, not just the first two:

| file | what to change |
|---|---|
| `CMakeLists.txt` | `project(AetherSDR VERSION …)` — the only one that reaches the binary |
| `README.md` | the **Current version:** line |
| `AGENTS.md` | this line |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | a new section at the top, under `## [Unreleased]` |
| `packaging/linux/io.github.aethersdr.aethersdr.metainfo.xml` | a new `<release …/>` entry — AppStream and Flathub read this, not the git tag |

`ROADMAP.md`'s "Current cycle" heading names the release too.

Leave every *historical* mention alone. "shipped v26.7.4" and "(v26.7.4)" are
statements about when something landed and stay true forever, so a blanket
find-and-replace across a version bump silently corrupts them.

### `CHANGELOG.md` is a release-prep file. Do not touch it in a feature PR.

The table above is the **only** reason to edit `CHANGELOG.md`: a new version
section, at release prep. An ordinary PR — a fix, a feature, a refactor —
**must not add an entry**, however user-visible the change is. Describe it in
the PR body and the commit message instead; those are where the reasoning
belongs and neither one conflicts with anything. At release prep, the section
is written *from* those PR bodies — `gh pr list --state merged --search
'merged:>=<last-tag-date>'` is the source of truth for what shipped.

This is a mechanical rule, not a stylistic preference. Every entry is prepended
to the top of the same `## [Unreleased]` list, so **any two PRs that both add
one conflict with each other**, and every PR still open when one of them merges
goes stale and needs a manual resolution. With a queue of concurrent agent PRs
that is not an occasional annoyance — it is a conflict on essentially every
pair. The file is append-mostly by nature and merges terribly by construction,
so the fix is to stop writing to it outside the one moment that needs it.

Reviewers: do not ask for a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and flag one as a change to
remove if a PR adds it. There has never been a written rule requiring per-PR
entries — `CONTRIBUTING.md` has never mentioned the file at all — but the habit
propagated anyway, by agents reading `git log` and copying what they saw. When
this rule landed it sat at 45% of recent merges (18 of the last 40, measured
2026-08-02), which is the worst of both worlds: not a convention anyone can
rely on, and enough churn to conflict constantly.

---

## CI/CD Workflow

CI runs in Docker image `ghcr.io/aethersdr/aethersdr-ci:latest` (~5 min builds).
**If you add a new `find_package(...)` to CMakeLists.txt, also add the
corresponding `-dev` package to `.github/docker/Dockerfile` and push.** The
`docker-ci-image.yml` workflow rebuilds the image automatically (~3 min); wait
for that before the next CI run can use it.

Branch protection: signed commits required on main, CI must pass, CODEOWNERS
review required, branches auto-delete after merge.

**Helping a contributor set up commit signing?** Read
`docs/COMMIT-SIGNING.md` — the top of that file has explicit
AI-assistant instructions (algorithm, anti-patterns, completion
message). Works for Windows / macOS / Linux / WSL / Raspberry Pi
contributors. Default to SSH signing; GPG is the fallback for
contributors with existing GPG workflows.

### Gate integrity

- The per-PR gate in `ci.yml` is frozen (see "Adding a test" above). A test
  does not join it. If a maintainer decides one must — the claim it pins is
  about a platform toolchain the weekly Linux lane cannot exercise — the
  name goes into `.github/ci-test-gate.txt` by hand, in the same PR, with
  the reason in the PR body; the step comment in `ci.yml` says what it
  guards. `--update` will not add a name.
- Every `ctest` invocation in a workflow carries `--no-tests=error`: a `-R`
  filter that matches nothing exits 0, so a deregistered or renamed test
  silently shrinks the gate while the job stays green — #5232 demonstrated
  this live. The unfiltered sanitizer sweep carries it too, so an empty
  test tree fails rather than passing vacuously.
- Erosion inside a pattern is caught two ways, and they cover different
  halves. The frozen list catches it in the SOURCE: the checker requires
  the names a PR workflow selects to EQUAL the list, so a renamed or
  deregistered `add_test` fails `Static checks` on the missing name. It
  cannot catch erosion at CONFIGURE time — it reads `tests.cmake` as text
  and does not evaluate the conditions around an `add_test`, so a test
  that stops being registered on a platform leaves the text unchanged and
  the list still matching. That is what the `Total Tests: N` pin on a
  multi-name step is for, and why the ThumbDV step still carries one
  (#5232, #5405 review). A single-name anchored step needs no pin:
  `--no-tests=error` already distinguishes one from zero.
- Deregistering or renaming a test requires grepping `.github/workflows/`
  for its name in the same PR, and running `--update` if it was on the
  frozen list. The gate regexes are part of the test's surface.
- The weekly lane's sticky failure issues (`[sanitizer] … weekly run
  failure`) carry ctest's own failed-test list first, then the sanitizer
  blocks. A test failing there on a plain assertion is a regression on
  `main` with no PR that went red for it; treat it as one.
- A flaky test gets an issue naming the root cause — never empty retrigger
  commits, which cost every contributor and record nothing.

## Architecture Overview

Key source directories: `src/core/` (protocol, audio, DSP), `src/models/`
(RadioModel, SliceModel, etc.), `src/gui/` (MainWindow, SpectrumWidget, applets).

**Key classes:**
- `RadioModel` — central state, owns connection + all sub-models
- `RadioSession` — per-radio aggregate that owns `RadioModel` + `TciServer` +
  `CatPorts`, giving teardown a structural order (#3351 / #3445)
- `AudioEngine` — RX/TX audio, NR2/RN2/NR4/BNR/DFNR DSP pipeline
- `SpectrumWidget` — GPU-accelerated FFT spectrum + waterfall (QRhiWidget)
- `MainWindow` — wires everything together, signal routing hub. **Decomposed
  (#3351)** into one class across `MainWindow.cpp` + `MainWindow_*.cpp` sibling
  TUs; new feature code goes in a sibling, NOT `MainWindow.cpp` — see
  [Adding code to MainWindow](#adding-code-to-mainwindow)
- `PanadapterStream` — VITA-49 UDP parsing, routes FFT/waterfall/audio/meters
- `CrossNeedleMeterGeometry` — PWR applet's cross-needle power/SWR face math.
  **Before touching the response model, SWR-contour construction, or label
  placement, read [`docs/cross-needle-meter-math.md`](docs/cross-needle-meter-math.md)** —
  the authoritative model + decision record (it exists because these formulas
  have churned when edited without a shared spec).

**Threading:** up to 13 threads — see `docs/architecture/pipelines.md` for the
full thread diagram, data flow, cross-thread signal map, and GPU rendering notes.

**Design principle:** RadioModel owns all sub-models on the main thread.
Worker threads communicate exclusively via auto-queued signals. Never hold
a mutex in the audio callback.

### In-flight: aetherd engine/UI decoupling (RFC accepted 2026-07-04)

The accepted RFC at
[`docs/aetherd-headless-engine-design.md`](docs/aetherd-headless-engine-design.md)
(tracking issue #3849) splits this codebase into an engine library
(`libaethercore`), a headless engine daemon (`aetherd`), and thin UI
clients, with pluggable radio backends (`IRadioBackend`). Implementation
follows the RFC's §10 staged order; **step 1 (`libaethercore`) and the
step-2 seam have landed** — the engine is a static library, and
`IRadioBackend` (`src/core/backends/`) now has **six** implementors,
selected at connect time by a `family` string through `makeBackend()`.
The seam's known gaps and the multi-radio migration order are tracked in
#5262 (M0–M6) and the review meta-issue #5554 — read both before changing
anything in this table's territory (see the temporary notice at the top of
"AI Agent Guidelines"). **Every implementor honours the THREADING AND
LIFETIME CONTRACT at the top of `IRadioBackend.h`** (backend lives on its
owner's thread, every seam signal is emitted from it, workers are private,
payloads declared and registered in one place, teardown bounded and
ordered). What is pinned versus surveyed: `backend_seam_affinity_test`
pins rules 1, 2 and 6 for the simulator and rule 1 plus a cold
construct/teardown for every other family; `hl2_connect_reentrancy_test`
pins rule 2 for HL2 while its DSP build runs on the I/O thread;
`backend_family_switch_test` pins rule 5 across the production switch with
a deterministic stale-delivery injection. Live-emission affinity for flex,
anan, icom and rtl is a survey result until
`tests/SeamThreadAffinityProbe.h` — which drops the same tripwire into any
test that drives a backend — is carried by a test that drives one.

**The probe table is GENERATED. Do not hand-edit it.** Adding a signal to
`IRadioBackend.h` means running `python tools/gen_seam_probe_table.py` and
committing `tests/SeamSignalProbeTable.inc`; `Static checks` runs the same
tool's `--check` on every PR and fails naming the signal you missed. It was
hand-maintained until #5868: #5825 added a signal without its probe line, was
green on every PR check, and broke `main` on the merge.

The families that seam carries today, and where each backend lives:

| Family | Backend | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `flex` | `FlexBackend` (`src/core/backends/flex/`) | SmartSDR wire stack; the Panadapter / Slice / Meter / Transmit / Amp / Tuner status+command paths decode behind it (2.2b–2.4) |
| `hl2` | `Hl2Backend` (`src/core/backends/hl2/`) | Hermes-Lite 2, shipped v26.7.4 — Metis/HPSDR transport, raw-IQ RX/TX DSP done in-client |
| `icom` | `IcomCivBackend` (`src/core/backends/icom/`) | Networked Icom, shipped v26.8.2 — CI-V command plane inside the RS-BA1 UDP transport; the radio owns its own state, so `clientSettingsDomains` is empty |
| `sim` | `SimBackend` (`src/core/backends/sim/`) | Synthetic demo backend, shipped v26.7.4 — generates its own audio + spectrum, RX-only by construction (Principle VI) |
| `anan` | `AnanBackend` (`src/core/backends/anan/`) | ANAN-G2 receive support over openHPSDR Ethernet Protocol 2; raw-IQ RX DSP runs in-client and TX remains absent by construction |
| `rtl` | `RtlSdrBackend` (`src/core/backends/rtl/`) | RTL-SDR USB receive backend; raw-IQ RX DSP runs in-client and the backend is RX-only by construction |

Step 3 is in progress: the normative v1 envelope contract, bounded codec,
observe-only local handshake/capability service, and a QtWidgets-free
`aetherd` skeleton have landed. The typed observe-only `server`,
`radioSession`, `slice`, and `panadapter` resources now publish through
`RadioResourceAdapter`; `resource.get` plus atomic snapshot/event
`resource.subscribe`/`resource.unsubscribe`, per-resource revisions, bounded
coalescing/session resync, and an independent local-socket hard disconnect cap
are live over the current-user local transport.
The headless daemon also owns a bounded, observe-only `radioCatalogue` through
the normalized `RadioDiscoverySource` seam. Native discovery adapters stay under
`src/core/backends/`; desktop discovery/autoconnect is unchanged. Discovery is
passive by default: `--discover-local` opts into Flex/HL2/ANAN LAN discovery and
available RTL-SDR USB enumeration; `--discover-sim` publishes only demo metadata.
Neither option connects a radio. Icom manual setup, SmartLink and external
directories are excluded. Catalogue fields and lifecycle are specified in
`docs/aetherd-control-resource-v1-catalogue.md`.
Sessions require explicit trusted authorization; the local transport defaults
to observe permission, and reads/subscriptions enforce it. The daemon's explicit
`--allow-local-control` flag additionally grants non-TX control to current-user
local clients. Typed catalogue-selected `radio.connect` / `radio.disconnect`
are implemented; see `docs/aetherd-local-connection-control.md` for lifecycle,
revision checks and limits. Clients cannot supply arbitrary endpoints or
credentials. Every negotiated session, observer or controller, now shares a
per-client request budget (100/s, burst 200, advertised in `limits`); exceeding
it is terminal for that connection. Terminal session cleanup discards pending
observations and synchronously retires bound authority before deferred socket
cleanup; unrecoverable output failure also revokes the session. Local input
processing yields after a bounded batch so a busy client cannot monopolize the
engine thread. There is no wire credential-provisioning or revocation method.
Explicit offline OS-vault setup and optional `--credential-authority` verification
are implemented; credential roles do not arm or key a radio. Provisioning and
serving share an authority reservation, and unavailable secure storage has no
plaintext fallback. See `docs/aetherd-stage4-client-grants.md` for the current
credential/lifetime contract. `--allow-local-tx` explicitly composes independent
grants, private TX/admin methods and operation-bound stop proof; it requires the
credential authority and local control, and starts disarmed. Initial backend
support covers compatible Flex LAN software PTT on SmartSDR TCP API 1.4 with
complete live interlock evidence, not a model/firmware-build allowlist. Hardware
coverage is FLEX-6700 firmware 4.2.18.41174; do not claim other models were tested.
See `docs/aetherd-flex-ptt-stop-evidence.md` for the shared protocol contract and
the separate hardware evidence record. Unsupported backends and
activities cannot issue a grant. Receive mutations also refuse retained TX
ownership, including acquired-but-not-keyed leases and unconfirmed cleanup.
`slice.setFrequency` now dispatches a bounded, revision-checked intent for an
existing owned slice, with explicit backend observation provenance and fail-closed
TX-idle admission; see `docs/aetherd-local-slice-frequency-control.md`. It does
not optimistically update the model. Unknown coverage/readback remains unavailable.
The receive-control milestone adds typed mode/filter/gain/mute and pan
center/bandwidth intents for qualified existing owned resources, separate
backend receive observations, bounded latest-value `meter` resources and a
read-only `transmitState`; see `docs/aetherd-local-receive-control.md` for the
per-backend support matrix and remaining no-op, geometry and TX-idle limits.
This is not all-backend feature parity: unavailable operations remain absent.
The desktop adapter has not landed; UI code still consumes models directly, and that
remains correct. New resource fields belong in the adapter and the versioned
catalogue, never in a transport or via QObject reflection. No protocol TX
method is advertised before the step-4 arbiter exists.

Step 4 has one engine-owned `TxCoordinator`, independent grant-bound actors,
and a transitional desktop actor. Flex primary keying and CWX text
carry operation/batch fences to the original TCP writer. A queue-consumed
callback ends local handoff only, never proves radio idle. Preserve normal
operator reengagement, but use `finishLocalIntent()` rather than asserting a
qualified stop: the coordinator retains that actor until matching stop evidence
arrives. Uncorrelated RX status must not clear this handoff barrier. Preserve
short key-down/key-up sequences, Quindar/RADE release tails, and held MOX when
cancelling a CWX batch. Do not enable independent-client handoff or daemon TX
until independent trusted grants and the qualified stop/recovery contract
are complete. See `docs/aetherd-stage4-tx-coordinator.md`. This work does not
widen `welcome`/capability serialization or replace #5598's RX PCM seam work.
The bridge watchdog tracks its authorization-lifetime producer's original
contributions with a monotonic, non-renewable deadline. A boolean keyed sample alone cannot establish ownership
(CWX has QSK gaps); repeated commands must not renew that deadline. Deferred
TX widget invocations retain the original input before queueing and
claim only after admission. These are producer-isolation safeguards, not
per-socket actor grants or qualified radio-idle evidence.

Local producer contributions now use opaque `TxCoordinator::Intent` handles,
not activity bits as ownership. Repeat admission reuses a producer's live
handle. Mark release before callbacks/queueing, retain the captured handle
until its normal tail is consumed, and end that handle only. Reengagement gets
a distinct handle so an earlier completion cannot release it. The coordinator
refuses local operation completion while any contribution remains. The six
legacy desktop entry points retain compatibility slots, while `TxController`
binds converted UI, device and bridge inputs to their actual producer. Capture
before the first queued hop; derive scheduled elements from the original root,
never from callback-time authority. Device close, authorization changes and
reconnect fence stale work. Keep TX audio context through backend queues and
retries. Producer identity still does not confer an independent actor grant.

**Backends that demodulate in-process double-feed the sink if you let
them.** `IRadioBackend::audioFrameReady` has two possible routes to
`AudioEngine::feedPcmFrame` — the `RadioModel::backendAudioFrameReady`
relay, and a direct connect in `wireBackendSeam()`. `FlexBackend` is
structurally immune because it never emits `audioFrameReady` at all (audio
rides `PanadapterStream`/VITA-49), so the "no double-feed" reasoning that
holds for Flex stops holding for any in-process backend.

**The two gates have opposite senses and are deliberately named apart — do
not merge them.** The relay's gate is `MainWindow::backendFeedsEngineDirectly()`
(`dynamic_cast<SimBackend*>`, `MainWindow_Session.cpp`): sim feeds the engine
itself, so the relay returns early for sim and for nobody else. The direct
connect in `wireBackendSeam()` is sim-only for the same reason, and *that* is
the site whose gate belongs on "does this backend own its RX audio"
(`MainWindow.cpp`). An HL2 is `ownsRxAudio() == true` **and** needs the relay,
so delegating the relay to `backend()->ownsRxAudio()` swallows every HL2 frame
and silences the speaker — the code says so at the function, citing the #4537
review. `Qt::UniqueConnection` does **not** protect you at either site: at the
relay they are two different signals arriving at the same slot, so nothing
looks duplicate to Qt, and at `wireBackendSeam()` it cannot catch a lambda
connect at all.

The spectrum side had the same shape and was resolved differently — not with a
gate but with one producer and one path: `spectrumFrameReady` is consumed by
`RadioModel::onBackendSpectrumFrame` and re-emitted on the neutral `panFeed`
path every backend already renders (`MainWindow.cpp`, "One producer, one
path"). Drawing it a second time at the seam is what that comment exists to
prevent.

**Build targets (post-RFC step 1):**

| Target | Contents | May link |
|---|---|---|
| `libaethercore` (`aethercore`) | `src/core/` + `src/models/` — the engine | Qt Core/Gui/Network/Multimedia/WebSockets/SerialPort/DBus, the DSP + third-party libs. Qt Gui remains because `BandPlanManager` and `DxccColorProvider` expose `QColor`; removing it is a burndown target. **Never `gui/` or QtWidgets**; the remaining EB2 warnings are source-location debt compiled only by the desktop target |
| `AetherSDR` | `src/gui/` + `main.cpp` — the desktop app | `aethercore` + Qt Widgets + qgeoview + QRhi private |
| `aetherd` | `src/aetherd/main.cpp` — headless service shell | `aethercore` + direct Qt Core/Network links. It currently inherits the engine's public/private runtime surface, including Qt Concurrent, Gui, Multimedia, SerialPort, WebSockets, DBus, and qtkeychain when those optional dependencies are enabled. Qt Gui remains because `BandPlanManager` and `DxccColorProvider` expose `QColor`; removing it and narrowing the other transitive edges are burndown targets. **Never QtWidgets** |

The dependency direction is CI-enforced (`tools/check_engine_boundary.py`,
`static-checks.yml`, `--strict`) by three ratchets:
- **EB1** — no `core/`/`models/` file may include a `gui/` header (now
  zero; any finding is an error).
- **EB2** — no `core/`/`models/` file may use QtWidgets (a shrinking
  tracked-legacy set warns, new usage errors).
- **EB3** — no file **above the radio seam** (all of `src/gui/`,
  `src/core/`, `src/models/`, plus the root app-shell files `src/main.cpp`
  and `src/MacStartupAbortGuard.{h,cpp}`, **except** the backend tree
  `src/core/backends/`) may include a **vendor header** — any radio-family-
  specific wire class the RFC keeps behind `IRadioBackend` (currently Flex,
  Kiwi, HL2, Sim, Icom, ANAN, and RTL; the headers tagged `vendor(...)` in
  `docs/architecture/aetherd-touchpoint-tags.json`). Only `vendor(...)` is
  EB3-gated: a standalone *accessory* device's own transport (the 4O3A
  antenna switch, the Tgxl/Pgxl direct sockets) is `peripheral(...)`, a
  USB input surface is `ui-support`, and a generic device model fused with
  vendor relay (e.g. `TunerModel`) is `mixed(flex)` — none of those are
  `vendor`, so none are EB3-gated. Today's coupling is
  frozen as a per-file, shrink-only baseline; a **new** above-seam vendor
  include, or an **increase** in a tracked file, errors. (RFC step 2.4;
  see "Engine boundary ratchet — EB3" below.)

If your change trips any of these, restructure the change — do not move
the file, weaken the check, or add an exemption. Engine code that needs a
UI callback defines a gui-free interface in `core/` (e.g.
`IConnectionAutomation`) that the gui implements — never a `gui/` include.

**Until migration rules appear in this file, nothing changes for you.**
Do not pre-emptively restructure code toward the RFC — no new engine/UI
seams, no backend interfaces, no speculative library targets. Each
migration step lands together with an update to this file stating the new
rules (pre-drafted in
[`docs/aetherd-agents-md-staging.md`](docs/aetherd-agents-md-staging.md));
if a rule isn't in this file, its step hasn't landed. Architecture changes
ahead of the RFC steps remain maintainer-only (see Autonomous Agent
Boundaries above). The CI-enforced rules so far — all three run in the
`Static checks` job, which became a **required status check on 2026-09-12**, so
a red run blocks the merge rather than merely reporting. Note what that does
*not* change: a finding against a TRACKED EB2/EB3 baseline still warns, and only
a new violation or a grown baseline errors:

- **EB1/EB2/EB3** above (`tools/check_engine_boundary.py`, warning for
  tracked baselines, error for new violations).
- **The capability-boolean freeze** (#5262 M2,
  `tools/check_capability_records.py`). `RadioCapabilities`' boolean
  population is frozen and may only shrink. **A new capability lands as a
  per-feature record** — `std::optional<FeatureRecord>`, engaged =
  present, fields = shape, the `cwText*` pattern generalized — not as
  another loose bool. Two reasons, both of which have already cost us:
  a bool encodes a yes/no that turns out to have shape and then fissions
  when the second radio family arrives (`hasRadioSideDsp` became four
  tiers, `hostModulates` became two fields), and a bool a backend simply
  forgot to set reports a definite "no" indistinguishable from a
  considered one. Converting one to a record means lowering
  `FROZEN_BOOL_COUNT` in the same commit.
- **The command-plane freeze** (#5262 M4,
  `tools/check_command_plane.py`). Raw Flex wire text above the seam is
  frozen per file and may only shrink; **a file not already in the
  baseline must stay at zero.** This is why the GUI↔Radio Sync note below
  describes the plane being migrated away from rather than a pattern to
  copy: on HL2/Icom/ANAN/RTL that text is silently dropped, so a new
  control written this way looks live and does nothing. New controls use
  a typed intent through `IRadioBackend`. Growth under
  `src/core/backends/flex/` is deliberately not counted — that is where
  the encode is moving to.

**Engine boundary ratchet — EB3 (vendor includes).** As of RFC step 2.4,
`check_engine_boundary.py` also enforces that nothing above the radio seam
reaches around `IRadioBackend` to a vendor wire class. What this means for
you:

- **Relocation does not convert a touchpoint.** Step 2.4 established the
  ratchet in place. The five Flex wire classes (`RadioConnection`,
  `PanadapterStream`, `SmartLinkClient`, `WanConnection`, `CommandParser`)
  now live under `src/core/backends/flex/` (#5554 §2.6 slice 1). Existing
  callers use those explicit paths and remain tracked by EB3; no forwarding
  headers or new include-directory shortcuts bypass the boundary. Demo-only
  compatibility data lives in `core/backends/DemoRadioConstants.h`, so the
  synthetic Flex connection does not include the concrete `SimBackend`.
- **The rule.** Each tracked file's baseline row is the exact **set** of
  vendor headers it may include. Adding a vendor `#include` (e.g.
  `KiwiSdrManager.h`, `RadioConnection.h`, `StreamStatus.h`) to a `gui/`,
  `core/`, or `models/` file that isn't tracked — or adding a header not
  in a tracked file's set, *including a lateral swap that keeps the count
  flat* (drop `RadioConnection.h`, add `KiwiSdrManager.h`) — fails the
  check. The per-file baseline (`KNOWN_VENDOR_INCLUDE_BASELINE`) lives at
  the top of `tools/check_engine_boundary.py`; the vendor vocabulary is
  **derived at runtime from the touchpoint audit**
  (`docs/architecture/aetherd-touchpoint-tags.json`, the single source of
  truth), so a header newly tagged `vendor` there is enforced without
  editing the checker. **De-classification is pinned, and only that
  direction.** `VENDOR_STEMS_PINNED` freezes today's 33 vendor stems: a stem
  the audit no longer tags `vendor(...)` is a blocking `EB3-load` error naming
  it, because that single edit would otherwise un-gate the header for every
  file above the seam on a green run. Tagging a *new* header `vendor(...)`
  arms more enforcement and needs no checker edit — arming must never cost a
  second diff. The only permitted rebaseline is an intentional
  vocabulary-classification change: every newly tracked include must be proven
  to predate that classification against the merge base, the evidence must be
  documented, and a maintainer must explicitly review the rebaseline — and the
  same evidence is what releases a stem from `VENDOR_STEMS_PINNED`, dropped in
  that same commit. The expanded set is shrink-only after classification.
- **Adding a radio feature?** Don't include the vendor class above the
  seam. Put the wire code in the family backend
  (`src/core/backends/<family>/`) and surface it through `IRadioBackend`
  (a canonical verb/signal, or the namespaced
  `invokeExtension`/`extensionStatus` channel for vendor-specifics), then
  consume *that* from the model/UI. Backend code (under
  `src/core/backends/`) and the vendor translation units themselves may
  include vendor headers freely — they're below the seam.
- **Removing coupling (the goal).** When you convert a file's radio access
  to the seam and drop a vendor include, **remove that stem from the
  file's row** in `KNOWN_VENDOR_INCLUDE_BASELINE` (delete the row when it
  empties). Outside the documented vocabulary-classification carveout above,
  the set only shrinks — never add a stem or a row to make a build pass. If EB3
  blocks you and the include is genuinely unavoidable, that's a design
  conversation for a maintainer, not a baseline edit.
- **`src/gui/**` is in the CI trigger** for `static-checks.yml` now
  (EB3 guards gui files), so a gui-only PR that adds vendor coupling is
  still caught.

**Where radio-facing code goes now that the seam exists.** Route by kind:

| Your change | Goes |
|---|---|
| Code speaking a vendor wire protocol (commands, discovery, stream parsing) | that family's backend under `src/core/backends/<family>/`, behind `IRadioBackend` — never in `gui/`, and increasingly not in the models (they're being decoupled from the wire over 2.2b–2.4) |
| A new radio family | a new `IRadioBackend` implementation under `src/core/backends/<family>/` — requires an approved design doc naming its open protocol authority (Constitution Principles I & IV apply per backend) |
| A new engine feature | `libaethercore`, exposed through models — never via a new gui→core header |

Do **not** reroute existing model↔wire code through `FlexBackend`
wholesale — the per-touchpoint conversion is staged work
(`docs/architecture/aetherd-touchpoints.md`). The five `mixed` models
(Radio/Slice/Transmit/Panadapter/Meter) have been split (2.3): their
SmartSDR status decode now lives in `FlexBackend` behind typed deltas, and
the models apply normalized signals. The amp (PGXL) and tuner (TGXL)
accessory models followed in 2.4 — `AmpModel` was extracted from
`RadioModel`, and their status decode and command encode now route through
`FlexBackend` too (#4099, #4101, #4113, #4192, #4200). The five Flex wire
classes are physically relocated, but their existing model/UI consumers are
not converted by that move. The EB3 ratchet (above) still freezes that
coupling while it is decoupled subsystem-by-subsystem. Other vendor headers
outside the backend tree remain staged work. Converting a touchpoint follows the claim
protocol + before/after `tools/verify_slice0_rx.py` recipe; a converted
file drops its vendor include and lowers its EB3 baseline.

**Before you merge — the aetherd conformance checklist.** Every item below has
a green CI run behind it, so a passing `Static checks` answers none of them.
Whoever lands a PR in this territory — agent or human, author or reviewer —
walks the list:

1. **Run the four gates on the merge base *and* on the head, and diff the
   findings per file** — not the exit codes. `check_engine_boundary.py
   --strict`, `gen_touchpoint_manifest.py --check`,
   `check_capability_records.py --strict`, `check_command_plane.py --strict`,
   all stdlib Python and seconds each. Findings against tracked EB2/EB3
   baselines *warn*; only a new violation or a grown baseline errors. EB2 is a
   per-file **count**, so a lateral swap inside a tracked file — one QtWidgets
   usage out, another in — passes flat.
2. **A new `gui/`→engine include stops at "regenerate", not at "justify".**
   `gen_touchpoint_manifest.py --check` *does* go red — the manifest records
   per-header includer counts, so the table goes stale and the required
   context fails. But regenerating clears it: commit the regenerated table and
   the grown burndown is green, with nothing anywhere flagging that a
   touchpoint was added. Diff the manifest between merge base and head. A new
   row, or a row whose includer count went up, needs a justification in the PR
   body, or it is a finding.
3. **Regenerate the manifest; never hand-edit it.** Run
   `python tools/gen_touchpoint_manifest.py` and commit the result. Editing the
   generated table, or adding a tag so the table matches, falsifies the
   burndown instead of fixing it.
4. **A baseline edit is never how a check goes green — but a reduction is
   required maintenance, not a finding.** Dropping a stem whose coupling the
   PR actually removed (and deleting the row when it empties), lowering
   `FROZEN_BOOL_COUNT` when a bool became a record, lowering a converted
   file's command-plane count: all of those are demanded above, and a
   conversion PR that does them is conforming, not weakening. What is
   forbidden is the other direction — growing a baseline, adding a stem or a
   row, or retagging a `vendor(...)` header. That last one un-gates the header
   for every file above the seam, since EB3 derives its vocabulary from
   `aetherd-touchpoint-tags.json` at runtime; it now fails as a blocking
   `EB3-load` naming the stem rather than passing quietly, and the failure is
   a design conversation, not a `VENDOR_STEMS_PINNED` edit. There, restructure
   the change.
   The two carveouts above (an EB3 vocabulary reclassification with merge-base
   proof and explicit maintainer review; a `FROZEN_BOOL_COUNT` raise on a
   maintainer ruling) are maintainer rulings carrying that evidence, never a
   route to a passing check.
5. **Touching a backend?** Read the THREADING AND LIFETIME CONTRACT in
   `IRadioBackend.h` against the diff, and re-read the #5554 notice at the top
   of "AI Agent Guidelines". What is pinned versus surveyed, and the probe to
   carry into a test that drives a backend, are stated at the head of this
   section — the point here is only that a survey result means reading is the
   check, because no test will fail.

## SmartSDR Protocol (v1.4.0.0)

### Message Types

| Prefix | Dir | Meaning |
|--------|-----|---------|
| `V` | Radio→Client | Firmware version |
| `H` | Radio→Client | Hex client handle |
| `C` | Client→Radio | Command: `C<seq>\|<cmd>\n` |
| `R` | Radio→Client | Response: `R<seq>\|<hex_code>\|<body>` |
| `S` | Radio→Client | Status: `S<handle>\|<object> key=val ...` |
| `M` | Radio→Client | Informational message |

Status object names are **multi-word** (`slice 0`, `display pan 0x40000000`,
`interlock band 9`). The parser finds the split between object name and
key=value pairs by locating the last space before the first `=` sign.

### Connection Sequence

1. TCP connect → radio sends `V<version>` then `H<handle>`
2. `sub <topic> all` for each of: `slice`, `pan`, `tx`, `amplifier`, `atu`,
   `meter`, `audio`, `gps`, `apd`, `client`, `xvtr`
3. `client gui` + `client program AetherSDR` + `client station AetherSDR`
4. Bind UDP socket, send `\x00` to radio:4992 (port registration)
5. `client udpport <port>` (returns error 0x50001000 on v1.4.0.0 — expected)
6. `slice list` → if empty, create default slice (14.225 MHz USB ANT1)
7. `stream create type=remote_audio_rx compression=none` → radio starts sending
   VITA-49 audio to our UDP port

### Protocol / Firmware Quirks (v1.4.0.0 protocol on fw 4.x)

- `client set udpport` returns `0x50001000` — use the one-byte UDP packet method
- `client set enforce_local_ptt=1` returns `0x50001000` — correct command is `client set local_ptt=1`; the radio echoes a full `connected` status to ALL clients updating their `local_ptt` field when ownership changes
- Slice frequency is `RF_frequency` (not `freq`) in status messages
- Streams are discriminated by **PacketClassCode** (PCC), NOT by packet type
- `audio_level` is the status key for AF gain (not `audio_gain`)
- The radio **never sends `mox=` in transmit status messages**. Use
  `isTransmitting()` (interlock state machine), NOT `isMox()`
- Three separate tune command paths all need interlock inhibit:
  `transmit tune 1`, `tgxl autotune`, `atu start`
- `cw key immediate` not supported — use netcw UDP stream for CW keying
- `transmit set break_in=1` wrong — correct: `cw break_in 1`

VITA-49 packet format, PCC codes, FFT bin conversion, waterfall tile format,
audio payload, meter data — see `docs/architecture/vita49-format.md`.

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Adding code to MainWindow

`MainWindow` was a ~19,500-line monolith; **#3351 split it into one class across
`MainWindow.cpp` + a family of `MainWindow_*.cpp` sibling TUs.** It is still one
`MainWindow` class — every sibling-TU function is a `MainWindow::` member
declared in `MainWindow.h`. The split is about *which file* a body lives in.

**Do not add new feature code to `MainWindow.cpp`.** Route it by subsystem:

| Your change | Goes in |
|---|---|
| Feature lifecycle/handler fitting an existing subsystem | that subsystem's TU — demods (RADE/FreeDV/DAX/RTTY/WFM) → `MainWindow_DigitalModes.cpp`; physical controllers → `MainWindow_Controllers.cpp`; SWR sweep → `MainWindow_SwrSweep.cpp`; spot clients → `MainWindow_Spots.cpp`; discovery/connection/pan-lifecycle → `MainWindow_Session.cpp`; client-DSP applets → `MainWindow_DspApplets.cpp` |
| Wiring a newly-created radio object (slice/pan/VFO/DSP) to the UI | `MainWindow_Wiring.cpp` |
| A menu item / action | `MainWindow_Menus.cpp` |
| A keyboard shortcut | `MainWindow_Shortcuts.cpp` |
| A stateless helper with no `MainWindow` dependency | `MainWindowHelpers.{h,cpp}` |
| A whole new subsystem with no TU home | a **new** `MainWindow_<Subsystem>.cpp` sibling — only if it's a cohesive subsystem ~500+ lines; smaller waits in the closest sibling |
| A member field, or a guard inside a function that can't move | stays in `MainWindow.{h,cpp}` (keep minimal) |

A new TU is not free — every sibling re-parses the ~1,000-line `MainWindow.h`,
and any header edit rebuilds all of them. Split only to a cohesive, reviewable
granularity, then **stop**: if tempted to subdivide one subsystem into several
thin TUs, extract a real class instead (the #3557 direction) — that's the only
move that actually decouples.

Sibling TUs must **carry their includes explicitly** — Qt reshuffles its
transitive includes between releases, and a distro Qt newer than the 6.12 pin
is a supported build, so a header that resolves transitively on one Qt need
not on another; don't rely on transitive includes (this broke #3532). When you move the last user of a header out of `MainWindow.cpp`, drop
that `#include` too.

Full map + decision guide:
**[`docs/architecture/mainwindow-decomposition.md`](docs/architecture/mainwindow-decomposition.md)**.

### Adding or converting a dialog

See **[`docs/style/dialog-patterns.md`](docs/style/dialog-patterns.md)** before writing
or modifying a `QDialog`. It documents the canonical
lazy-construct + non-modal + geometry-persist + frameless-chrome pattern,
the common pitfalls that have hit real PRs, and the existing dialogs to
use as reference. Tracked for cleanup in #2605 (`PersistentDialog` base
class).

Any new popout window, floating tool window, or `QDialog` must respect the
global `FramelessWindow` setting unless there is a specific reason not to.
Use the existing frameless helpers instead of custom window chrome:

- Add a `FramelessWindowTitleBar` at the top of the dialog/window layout.
- Install `FramelessResizer::install(this)` for resizable popouts.
- Add `setFramelessMode(bool on)` using the same pattern as
  `NetworkDiagnosticsDialog`: capture geometry, toggle
  `Qt::FramelessWindowHint`, restore geometry only if the window was already
  visible, show again only if it was already visible, and hide/show the custom
  title bar based on the setting.
- Initialize from `AppSettings::instance().value("FramelessWindow", "True")`.
- Do not use `QSettings`.

Do not manually move first-show dialogs to `(0,0)` or restore constructor-time
geometry. For first show, either let Qt/window-manager placement handle it, or
use the same placement behavior as the closest existing dialog. If centering is
explicitly required, do it deliberately after the dialog has a valid size and
document why.

### Settings Persistence (AppSettings — NOT QSettings)

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use `QSettings` anywhere in AetherSDR. All client-side
settings are stored via `AppSettings` (`src/core/AppSettings.h`), which
persists to a **SQLite database** named `AetherSDR.db` in
`SettingsPaths::configDir()` — `QStandardPaths::GenericConfigLocation` +
`/AetherSDR`, i.e. `~/.config/AetherSDR/` on Linux,
`~/Library/Preferences/AetherSDR/` on macOS and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AetherSDR\`
on Windows. Always route store paths through `SettingsPaths`, never through
`QStandardPaths` directly (RFC #4603; design doc:
`docs/settings-store-sqlite-design.md`).
Key names use PascalCase (e.g. `LastConnectedRadioSerial`,
`DisplayFftFillColor`). Boolean values are stored as `"True"` / `"False"`
strings.

```cpp
auto& s = AppSettings::instance();
s.setValue("MyFeatureEnabled", "True");
bool on = s.value("MyFeatureEnabled", "False").toString() == "True";
s.save();   // commits the dirty rows in one transaction (cheap; still required)
```

Rules that come with the store:

- **Never include `sqlite3.h` outside `src/core/SettingsDatabase.cpp`** — the
  engine is a single-point seam (see `third_party/sqlite/README.md`).
- **Credentials never go in the settings store.** QtKeychain (service
  `"AetherSDR"`) is the only persistent credential store; without keychain
  support a credential is session-only via
  `AppSettings::setSessionCredential()`. The known credential names live in
  ONE table — `src/core/SettingsCredentialPolicy.h` — shared by the import
  exodus, the export sanitizer, the `setValue()` seam guard, and the CLI, so
  add new credentials THERE (the seam then enforces the policy for you).
  Follow the patterns in
  `MqttSettings`/`AutomationBridgeSettings`/`CopyAssistSettings`.
- The legacy XML file (`AetherSDR.settings`) is a **frozen snapshot** from the
  one-time import — never write to it, never delete it outside Reset Settings.
- Pre-`QApplication` code reads via `SettingsBootstrap::readValue()` and paths
  come from `SettingsPaths` — never hand-build a config path.
- The `AetherSDR --config <list|get|set|unset|export|features|path>` CLI inspects and
  repairs the store without starting the GUI (the recovery path when a stored
  value breaks startup).

### Radio-Scoped Feature Documents (`radio_settings`)

Radio-scoped configuration — state that belongs to one physical radio or one
backend family — does NOT go in flat `AppSettings` keys. It goes in the
`radio_settings` table as **one versioned JSON document per feature per scope**
(Constitution Principle V, realized in the store):

```cpp
const RadioSettingsScope scope = m_radioModel.settingsScope();  // (family, serial)
// Read-modify-write uses the EXACT row (no family-wide fallback — you must
// not clone the family default into a per-radio row), and the write result
// is checked: a refused write that the UI repaints over is the worst
// failure shape.
QJsonObject doc = scope.featureExact("MyFeature");
doc.insert("field", newValue);
if (!scope.setFeature("MyFeature", kMySchemaVersion, doc)) {
    qWarning() << "MyFeature: settings write did not persist";
}
// (scope.feature() — exact → family-wide → {} — is for CONSUMERS reading
// effective config, not for writers.)
```

- Identity comes from `RadioModel::settingsScope()` (Flex serial / HL2 MAC /
  Kiwi UUID) — never re-derive it yourself. An empty `radio_id` row is the
  family-wide default; guard against writing one by accident when the serial
  isn't known yet (see `BandStackSettings` for the pattern).
- **Check the write result.** `setFeature()` can refuse (read-only store,
  reset in progress); a mutation that silently doesn't persist while the UI
  repaints from the store is the worst failure shape (PR #4621 review). Log
  loudly at minimum.
- Writers judging the row they're about to replace use the **exact** read
  (`featureExact()`), not the fallback-composed one; and never overwrite a
  document whose `schema_version` is newer than yours — refuse and log
  (see `RadioStateMemory::store()` for the canonical shape).
- Shipped precedents: the HL2 `OperatingState` document (per-band drive/LNA
  maps in its extension), the `Identity` nickname document, and `BandStack`
  (#4621), and the shared memory bank at `(local, '', MemoryBank)` (#4623).

### Client-Side Radio State Memory (capture/restore)

For radios that persist nothing themselves, the client is the radio's memory —
but only through the one sanctioned pipeline:

- A backend declares WHICH state the client owns via
  `RadioCapabilities::clientSettingsDomains` (typed per-domain flags; empty =
  restore nothing). **Flex and Sim declare explicitly empty** — a CI test
  guards this, because a non-empty Flex declaration would re-introduce the
  #2465/#4126/#4261 re-assert-stale-state bug class.
- `RadioStateMemory` is the ONLY reader/writer of the `OperatingState`
  document; engagement is `shouldEngage(caps)` — capability-shaped, **never a
  family-name check**. `RadioModel` hands restored state to the backend
  unconditionally before `connectRadio()` (an empty state is the reset that
  prevents same-family radio-swap bleed), and debounces capture (2 s trailing
  + 10 s max-wait) with an explicit flush on disconnect AND in
  `MainWindow::closeEvent()` (quit doesn't pump the queued path).
- The backend validates everything it restores at its own boundary
  (Principle VII) and **restore never keys transmit** (Principle VI) —
  restored values are setpoints; the TX gate is untouched.
- The extension document's top level is domain-named sub-objects gated
  per-domain by the engine; the CONTENTS of each sub-object are the backend's
  own (opaque above the seam).

### Settings Migration

One-time migrations when renaming or restructuring keys (e.g. `Applet_DIGI` →
`Applet_CAT`, `DaxTxGain` → `TciTxGain`):

```cpp
auto& s = AppSettings::instance();
if (s.contains("OldKey") && !s.contains("NewKey")) {
    s.setValue("NewKey", s.value("OldKey", "default").toString());
    s.remove("OldKey");
    s.save();
}
```

Run once at app or feature startup, not on every access. (The XML→SQLite store
migration itself is automatic inside `AppSettings::load()` — feature code never
touches it.)

**Migrating a legacy side file into scoped documents** follows the
claim-and-freeze pattern (precedents: `Hl2Discovery` nicknames and
`BandStackSettings`, `LocalMemoryBank`):

- Claim lazily, per scope, on first access — the document needs the radio's
  FAMILY, which only the live scope knows.
- The document's existence is the migration marker; a **present-but-empty**
  document blocks re-import (an operator who emptied a store must not have it
  resurrected by a restored backup).
- The legacy source stays **frozen** (or per-section-pruned, for multi-radio
  files) as the downgrade snapshot — never rewritten with new data.
- Memoize only *settled* states (document exists, claim succeeded, section
  confirmed absent); every retryable condition (file missing, unparseable,
  write refused) must retry on the next access, not be latched away.

### Settings Authority Policy (radio-authoritative vs client-owned)

**The radio is always authoritative for any setting it can store** (Constitution
Principles II & III) — and the deciding test is Constitution III's own:
*whether THIS radio can save and restore the value*, which since RFC #4603 is a
**declared capability, not a family assumption**:

- **On a radio that persists its own state (Flex)**: never save, recall, or
  override radio-side settings from client-side persistence. The lists below
  apply verbatim, and `clientSettingsDomains` is declared EMPTY.
- **On a radio that persists nothing and declares so (HL2 today)**: the
  client IS the radio's memory — for exactly the domains the backend declares
  in `RadioCapabilities::clientSettingsDomains` (Sim deliberately declares
  none: a synthetic scene has nothing worth remembering), persisted ONLY through
  `RadioStateMemory`'s `OperatingState` document (see "Client-Side Radio State
  Memory" above). Never in flat `AppSettings` keys, and never via ad-hoc code
  paths — the one pipeline is what keeps the Flex guarantees provable.

**Radio-authoritative on Flex (do NOT persist client-side):** frequency, mode,
filter, step size, AGC, squelch, DSP flags, antennas, TX power, panadapter
*count* and per-pan state (center, bandwidth, min/max dBm, FFT
average/FPS/weighted-average, and waterfall line duration).

**Client-authoritative everywhere (persist in AppSettings):** window geometry,
layout arrangement (`PanadapterLayout`, applet order/visibility), client-side
DSP (NR2/RN2/NR4/DFNR), UI preferences, client-only display appearance
preferences, spot settings.

**Why (the Flex half):** when both the client and a self-persisting radio
store the same setting, they fight on reconnect — the radio's GUIClientID
session restore is always more current than our saved copy. On a declared-
domain radio there is no second store to fight with, which is exactly why the
client may hold the state there and only there.

**Anti-pattern (recurring — see #4261):** Do not write a radio-echoed status
value into a setter that *also* persists it to `AppSettings`. That makes the
client re-assert stale state on reconnect / profile load and fight the radio —
the exact class of bug behind #2465, #4126, #4081, #4083, and #4261. For a
radio-authoritative field, route status straight to the display (a plain member
+ signal) and never call `AppSettings::setValue()` in its setter. When a display
setter genuinely persists (e.g. waterfall *appearance*: color gain, black
level), that value must be client-only — never a value the radio also echoes.

### GUI↔Radio Sync (No Feedback Loops)

> **The `commandReady` plane is FROZEN and is being removed** (#5262 M4).
> It is described here because most of the tree still uses it, not as the
> pattern for new work: the wire text below is Flex-only and is silently
> dropped on HL2/Icom/ANAN/RTL, so a new control written this way is a

- Model setters emit `commandReady(cmd)` → `RadioModel` sends to radio
- Radio status pushes update models via `applyStatus(kvs)`
- Use `m_updatingFromModel` guard or `QSignalBlocker` to prevent echo loops

### Auto-Reconnect

`RadioModel` has a 3-second `m_reconnectTimer` for unexpected disconnects.
Disabled by `m_intentionalDisconnect` flag on user-initiated disconnect.

### Optimistic Updates Policy

Some radio commands lack status echo (e.g. `tnf remove`). Update the local
model optimistically. **File a GitHub issue** tagged `protocol` + `upstream`
for each missing status echo — optimistic updates break Multi-Flex.

### Meter Smoothing — use MeterSmoother

Every meter / level-bar / GR readout in the GUI must drive its display
value through `MeterSmoother` (`src/gui/MeterSmoother.h`). Don't write
new envelope-follower code or copy smoothing logic from other widgets
— `MeterSmoother`'s header has the API and a usage example.

### User-facing names match the on-screen UI labels

In prose (issue comments, README, What's-New strings, error toasts, support
requests) call a control by the label the user sees, not the C++ class name —
e.g. the **DIGI applet** (class `CatApplet`), and the Help → Support logging
toggles **Discovery / Commands / Status** (not backend names like
`radio.connection`). The on-screen label wins for prose, so users can find the
control you're naming.

### Region-aware band data — read from BandPlanManager, not BandDefs.h

Anything needing band edges, segment sizes, or per-band metadata reads the
active plan via `BandPlanManager` (`AppSettings["BandPlanName"]` + the JSON in
`resources/bandplans/`). `src/models/BandDefs.h::kBands[]` is ARRL/US-only and
not region-aware — don't source new features from it; AetherSDR's users span
IARU regions 1/2/3.

### TX DSP stages integrate with the CHAIN widget

The TX DSP chain is stage-per-applet and the visual **CHAIN** widget is the
primary entry point. New TX DSP stages must be ordered, toggleable, and
inspectable through the CHAIN widget rather than adding a parallel UI entry —
it's the user's mental model for the TX signal path.

### The About-dialog Contributors list is auto-generated

The Contributors list in the About dialog is built at runtime from the GitHub
API; manual edits are overwritten on the next build. If someone is missing, fix
the GitHub-side attribution (commit authorship / `Co-Authored-By` trailer),
don't patch the dialog string.

## Multi-Panadapter Support

**Architecture:** PanadapterModel (per-pan state), PanadapterStream (VITA-49
routing by stream ID), PanadapterStack (QSplitter), wirePanadapter() (per-pan
signal wiring), spectrumForSlice() (overlay routing).

**Key protocol facts:**
- Click-to-tune: `slice m <freq> pan=<panId>` — NOT `slice tune`
- Never send `slice set <id> active=1` — managed client-side only
- Push `xpixels`/`ypixels` on pan creation (radio defaults to 50×20)
- FFT stream ID = pan ID (0x40xx), waterfall stream ID = waterfall ID (0x42xx)

See `docs/architecture/multi-pan-pitfalls.md` for 20 numbered lessons learned.

---

## Multi-Client (Multi-Flex) Support

Filter all status and VITA-49 packets by `client_handle` — three layers:
1. **Slice ownership**: track `m_ownedSliceIds` from `client_handle` field
2. **Panadapter status**: only claim `display pan`/`display waterfall` matching our handle
3. **VITA-49 UDP**: `setOwnedStreamIds(panId, wfId)` drops non-matching packets

Early status messages arrive WITHOUT `client_handle`. Create SliceModels for
all initially, remove other clients' when handle arrives.

---

## KiwiSDR Public-Receiver Browser

The KiwiSDR browser is a clean-room, API-policy-aware public-receiver directory
(#3679) — find and connect to public KiwiSDR receivers, independent of the
FlexRadio protocol path. Kiwi panadapters are receive-only (TX is inhibited).
See `docs/kiwisdr-public-directory.md` (directory / API-policy behaviour) and
`docs/kiwisdr-cleanroom-design.md` (clean-room design notes, Principle IV).

The Kiwi path also serves the Web-888 (a KiwiSDR server fork) as a receiver
family: profiles carry a receiver type, and the client applies the small wire
deltas. See `docs/web888-cleanroom-design.md`.

---

## Accessibility — `src/gui/` Rules

Touching any file under `src/gui/`? Read [`docs/a11y.md`](docs/a11y.md)
**before** adding or modifying a widget. Canonical Qt patterns:
`setAccessibleName` / `setAccessibleDescription`, `QAccessibleValueChangeEvent`
on every value-change method, `QAccessibleInterface` subclass for any
`paintEvent` override, and the interactive-`QLabel` anti-pattern (replace
with `QPushButton` or add keyboard activation).

CI enforcement: [`tools/check_a11y.py`](tools/check_a11y.py) runs on every
PR via [`.github/workflows/static-checks.yml`](.github/workflows/static-checks.yml)
and emits inline diff annotations for the patterns above. Warning-only
(`exit 0`); never blocks a build.

## Agent Automation Bridge — verify the GUI without pixels

Need to assert on UI state, drive a control, confirm a widget rendered, or
capture the panadapter while verifying a change? AetherSDR ships an in-process,
agent-drivable bridge (off in production). Launch with `AETHER_AUTOMATION=1`
and drive a `QLocalServer` that speaks newline-delimited JSON:

- `dumpTree` → semantic snapshot of the whole widget tree (objectName,
  accessibleName, enabled, geometry, live `value`) — your "DOM" for controls.
- `grab <widget>` → PNG of any widget, including a correct GPU-framebuffer
  readback of the panadapter (`SpectrumWidget`).
- `invoke <target> <action> [value]` → click/toggle/setValue/setText/… a
  control. **Refuses any control marked transmit-keying (`markTxKeying()` /
  `aetherTxKeying` property — MOX/PTT, TUNE, ATU, CWX send, packet/APRS send)
  unless `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1`** — the bridge can never key a live
  radio by accident; setpoint sliders ("Tune power", "RF power") stay drivable.
  Marked controls show `"keying": true` in `dumpTree`. Also **refuses disabled
  controls** (no silent no-op). Disambiguate duplicate names with a scoped
  target: `"RxApplet/AF gain"` vs `"PanadapterApplet/AF gain"`.
- `get radio|transmit|equalizer|slice|slices|pan|pans [selector] [property]` →
  live JSON model snapshot (frequency, mode, filter, NB/NR, squelch/AGC/APF,
  center MHz, min/max dBm, RF/mic/CW TX-chain, EQ bands, …). Assert on truth
  without screenshots. Sliders/spinboxes also report `range` in `dumpTree`.

Quick start: `python3 tools/automation_probe.py demo` (no Qt dependency); also
`get radio`, `invoke 'Master volume' setValue 35`. Full reference — protocol,
JSON schemas, targeting rules, recipes, gotchas — in
**[`docs/automation-bridge.md`](docs/automation-bridge.md)**. This is the
deterministic, cross-OS way to do "snapshot → act → assert" on the native UI
(issue [#3646](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/3646)).

**MCP server (for AI assistants).** The same bridge is also exposed over the
**Model Context Protocol**, so an MCP-capable assistant can drive AetherSDR
through schema-validated tools instead of raw JSON. It's enabled from a Radio
Setup toggle and guarded by token auth; the common verbs (tune, slice, pan,
connect, record, mark, menu, floors, streams, capture_audio, …) are surfaced as
first-class typed tools, alongside robustness helpers (`wait_for`,
`assert_state`, fuzzy `did_you_mean` target resolution), a guided
`validate_ui_change` prompt, and read-only live-state resources. The same TX
gate applies — keying verbs stay behind `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX`. Regenerate
the verb→tool tables with `tools/gen_bridge_docs.py` (a CI check fails on drift).
See `docs/automation-bridge.md` for setup and the tool catalog.
