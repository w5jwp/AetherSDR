## [v26.9.5] — 2026-09-27

### Split remembers your audio, the chain windows gain live controls and noise reduction goes stereo · the ANAN-G2 gets an S-meter, noise blanker and WDSP panadapter, and the Hermes-Lite 2 hears 84 ms sooner

52 merged changes from 13 human contributors, AetherClaude and one Dependabot update within that total. The operator-facing half makes split remember how you set up its audio and adds Monitor TX and Split Up. AetherRX and AetherTX get BYPASS, REC and PLAY at the foot of their stage columns, every client noise-reduction method denoises left and right independently, and a Window menu joins the menu bar. The ANAN-G2 takes the largest step since it arrived: an S-meter, a WDSP-computed panadapter at one point per pixel, the noise blanker and RF-gain attenuation. The Hermes-Lite 2 cuts receive latency by 84 ms outside CW and stops hearing its own carrier after an unkey. Underneath, the Flex wire classes move behind the backend directory, the seam's probe table is generated rather than hand-kept, and both FFTW planners are serialized.

### Split, receive and transmit chains

- **Split remembers your audio arrangement, with Monitor TX and Split Up (#5922).** The transmit slice is no longer born muted on every split. Unmute it, set its level, pan it and the receive slice apart, and every later split comes back the same way. Only the transmit slice's mute, level and pan are learned, plus the receive slice's pan if you moved it, and only from your own VFO, applet, keyboard and controller edits, never from TCI, CAT or radio status. Ending a split with the transmit slice muted forgets the arrangement. **Monitor TX (Hold)** is the `XFC`/`TF-SET`/`TXW` equivalent, either soloing the transmit frequency or making both slices audible for the hold. **Split Up 1 / 5 / 10 kHz** moves the transmit slice or starts a split at that offset. Right-clicking the SPLIT badge shows all of it and a way to forget what is remembered. Monitor TX is unbound by default.
- **AetherRX and AetherTX: live controls in the stage column (#5913).** BYPASS moves out of each window's Settings dialog into the foot of the stage column, with a REC / PLAY pair above it. AetherTX's pair drives the transmit monitor. AetherRX's pair records received audio through the same routing as the VFO flag's record buttons. RX BYPASS now switches off whichever of the seven NR methods is running and restores it on release. Right-clicking AetherRX's PLAY offers **TX Playback**, which transmits the last client-side recording over the active slice, capped at the Recording section's idle timeout and ending with the transmitter released on any refusal or disconnect. The AetherRX and AetherTX launchers on the VFO flag are now always the same width.
- The TX compressor's Drive and Phase settings are saved in and restored from channel-strip presets and AetherTX profiles. Older presets without them keep the current values (#5963).

### Noise reduction and DSP

- **Every client NR method denoises left and right independently (#5971).** NR4, DFNR, NNR and BNR used to fold to mono and rebuild stereo through a balance follower. A hard pan took about 5 seconds to land, and diversity receive put the same blended antenna in both ears. NR2 and MNR kept each channel's waveform but ran one noise estimate on the mix. All six now run one instance per channel, the way RN2 already did, so a pan is instant and each ear keeps its own antenna.
- Both FFTW planners are serialized: double precision under one process-wide lock shared by NR2, WDSP, the HL2 and the ANAN, and single precision under its own lock for the RTL-SDR and NR4 (#5902).
- WDSP patch 13 takes the worker's input before releasing a blocked host. Previously the worker could read an overwritten slot and report nothing. Production channels open non-blocking and are unaffected; the offline blocking-mode tests that went intermittently red now pass (#5960).
- `WdspChannel` gains a settable FM detector deviation (default 5 kHz, unchanged) and runtime setters for the RX filter length and phase that keep the notch database. (#5872, #5878).

### Meters, menus and panadapter

- **One set of meter ballistics everywhere (#5847).** SmartMTR's ballistics are now the project's: `MeterSmoother` defaults to its 18.2 ms attack and 269 ms release, the six per-applet overrides are deleted, and `HGauge` peak markers run on SmartMTR's sliding-window engine instead of five hand-rolled hold-and-decay copies. Device-reported peaks such as the TGXL's `peak` and the radio's MICPEAK keep their own path.
- **rigctl `STRENGTH` reports a real signal level (#5849).** It handed every hamlib client on every backend a constant −57.0 dB. It now reads the S-meter of the VFO-resolved slice. `get radio`.`txPower`, which read 0.0 W at every drive, now publishes display-smoothed measured forward power, or `null` when it is not live. `get meters`.`sLevel` answers only when exactly one slice declares an S-meter.
- A **Window menu** between View and Help lists the open top-level windows, with Minimize, Zoom, Full Screen and Bring All to Front. Minimal Mode moves to Ctrl+Shift+M on every platform, freeing Command-M for Minimize on macOS (#5891).
- Leaving minimal mode no longer crashes on Intel D3D11; the spectrum is shown only after the window's geometry is restored (#5916). macOS native menus no longer disappear after an automation-bridge menu lookup (#5926).
- Band and segment zoom are gated on the radio's capability on all seven surfaces that reach them (shortcuts, MIDI, FlexControl, HID buttons, wheels and the bridge), not only the two on-screen buttons (#5875).
- The **Glacier** waterfall palette joins the gradient choices (#5843). Radio Setup's value labels, captions and line edits follow the theme, so Default Light no longer draws near-white text on a near-white dialog (#5863, #5898). The PSK Reporter stats row is transparent on the footer surface (#5888).

### CW, RTTY, Clock and TCI

- **CW, RTTY and AetherClock decode the selected slice's audio (#5758).** On a Flex, assigning a DAX RX channel to the selected slice decodes that slice alone, independent of speaker gain and mute. Without one, the decoders use the shared receive stream as before, and the panel says so (`RX: shared audio`). Retuning the selected slice now resets decoder state so text from the previous signal cannot publish; operator pitch and speed locks survive. This is RFC #5468's A5 increment.
- **TCI streaming runs on its own I/O thread (#5840).** WebSockets, RX and TX conversion and pacing move off the model thread, while protocol control, routing and every model access stay on their owner. PTT still passes through the main-thread TX coordinator. This is the first isolation stage of RFC #5682.

### Amplifiers, tuners and devices

- The TGXL port strips no longer label ports `RF SENSE`, a trigger mode the protocol never reports. A port's source is shown only while the tuner has a live reading on it. BYPASS → STANDBY is commanded operate-first, so it no longer flashes OPERATE on the way down (#5883).
- Contour ShuttleXpress and ShuttlePro v2 buttons are decoded from the right bytes, so all five and all fifteen buttons report as themselves (#5931).

### Hermes-Lite 2

- **The band returns 84 ms sooner (#5954).** Outside CW the RX bandpass runs at minimum phase, at the same length, magnitude response and notch depth. Receive audio returns 44 ms after an unmute instead of 128 ms, which is 84 ms less latency on all SSB, AM, FM and digital receive audio, not only after an unkey. CW keeps linear phase. WDSP patch 12 plans the minimum-phase design FFTs with `FFTW_ESTIMATE`, so a minimum-phase open on an empty wisdom cache takes 10.9 s instead of 103.9 s. This closes #5498.
- **The PA's own carrier stops reaching the demodulator after an unkey (#5850).** The receive unmute is deferred past the T/R turnaround, removing a +57 dB leak (#5497). It ships in the same release as #5954, as ruled, because on its own it lengthens the post-unkey gap. In CW full break-in the hold is skipped only when the break-in delay is shorter than the hold. #5855 adds the test that measures pre-mute audio persisting across the mute edge.
- **Declare which HL2 variant is on the bench (#5867).** A per-radio hardware document for a bare HL2, the AK4951 companion board or a SquareSDR 2: the codec (which gates the EP2 audio slot and can feed the radio's own loudspeaker), the dither and random bits under the selected board's labels, the N2ADR filter board (RX+TX or TX-only), the gateware-driven ATU and the speaker level.
- **An unvisited band comes up at +20 dB LNA gain on every profile (#5869).** `rfGain.defaultDb` was never written and was read back forever. It is no longer persisted or read. Profiles that carried a stuck value (the reporting station's was −6 dB) now come up **26 dB hotter** on a band not yet visited. Visited bands keep their stored gain, and no transmit path reads this value.
- The second and later receivers' S-meters reach their slices instead of being computed and discarded (#5866). The FM repeater-duplex and CTCSS-encode controls the HL2 has no verb for are withdrawn, and DSB, CWU and CWL are declared (#5879). A radio that goes silent is asked to stream again before the link is declared down (#5882).
- Health and telemetry: wideband ADC health rows expire when the bandscope stream stops rather than showing a frozen block as current (#5880). New counters record the substituted silence the host's TX IQ queue sends, which the radio's FIFO telemetry cannot see (#5881). Switching automatic RF gain off after a refused arm is now recorded, so the next connect does not re-arm it (#5862).
- `Hl2Spectrum` gains power-domain frame averaging, taking the log once at emit; production still emits one frame (#5833). New test coverage for the FFTW setup lock (#5876), and `docs/HERMES.md` and the waterfall comments corrected to what landed (#5874, #5877).

### Flex, Icom and ANAN

- **ANAN-G2: an S-meter, a WDSP panadapter, the noise blanker and RF-gain attenuation.** The panadapter is computed with WDSP's display analyzer, averaging a ≥16384-point Kaiser-windowed FFT so no IQ is thrown away (at 192 ksps about 87% used to be). FFT AVG and Weighted average now drive it (#5814), and it returns one point per screen pixel (#5920). The S-meter publishes WDSP's average reading through arithmetic and ballistics now shared with the HL2 (#5818). The NB button runs WDSP's impulse blanker on raw IQ and survives reconnects and rate changes (#5824). RF Gain from −31 to 0 dB drives the ADC step attenuator, restored per radio (#5820). The G2 remains receive-only. **On upgrading**, G2 panadapter tones read about 7.4 dB lower than before (a test tone that read −6.0 dB now reads −13.4 dB; the G2 is not dBm-calibrated yet), so a saved reference level or waterfall black level wants re-trimming once (#5814).
- **The IC-7300MK2 connects as a supported radio (#5871).** Over built-in Ethernet/RS-BA1, a radio identified by CI-V as an IC-7300MK2 no longer shows the EXPERIMENTAL badge or disclaimer (RFC #5517). Every other Icom model keeps the experimental treatment. Connect-time Flex-only writes are gated on the Flex command plane, so they no longer raise unsupported-control warnings.

### Backend seam and aetherd

- The Flex wire classes (`RadioConnection`, `PanadapterStream`, `SmartLinkClient`, `WanConnection`, `CommandParser`) move into `src/core/backends/flex/`. Demo constants move into a backend-only header, so `RadioConnection` no longer includes the simulator. This is #5554 §2.6 slice 1 (#5834).
- The seam probe table is generated from `IRadioBackend.h`, with a `Static checks` gate, so a declared signal cannot go unprobed (#5897). #5865 repaired the `main` red that motivated it. The capability-record ratchet no longer loses the bool declared after an accessor (#5860).

### Project and packaging

- The Windows installer compiles whisper/ggml-vulkan from source, so vendored ASR patches reach Windows releases; the prebuilt asset remains the fallback (#5816).
- `/release-prep` and `/tag-release` are checked in as project skills (#5864, #5885), owned by `@aethersdr/infrastructure` (#5884).
- `jurplel/install-qt-action` moves to 4.4.1 (#5955).

## [v26.9.4] — 2026-09-20

### AetherRX and AetherTX as one window each, Neural Noise Reduction and global precipitation · the Hermes-Lite 2 transmits through WDSP and reads its meters honestly

97 merged changes from 13 human contributors, AetherClaude and two Dependabot updates within that total. The operator-facing half rebuilds the receive and transmit chains into one window each, brings WDSP 2.10 in with Neural Noise Reduction as a seventh client-side NR method, puts worldwide precipitation on the PSK Reporter map and gives the TGXL and PGXL front-panel presentations. The Hermes-Lite 2 gets the largest share of the rest: an ALC that only reduces, a WDSP TXA modulator keyed on the air and made the default, a derived dBm reference, a wideband bandscope and an S-meter that no longer reads the noise floor from a peak-hold. Underneath, aetherd gains credential-bound transmit grants, and the recorder, DVK, PMS and settings store all stop lying about failed writes.

### Receive and transmit chains

- **AetherRX — the receive chain in one window (#5805).** Every page now reads the same way: switches along the top, the display under them, every knob in one row at the foot. The tab column down the left *is* the chain — each row carries an enable checkbox and a grip, and dragging a row rewrites the RX chain order. Tabs are renamed to Gate, Compressor, Exciter and Final Output; the old spellings still resolve. Settings gains a profile library (save, load, import, export) that captures every stage's parameters, enablement, order and the active NR method as one nested-JSON document, and the EQ page draws the receive filter edges with the mode's width ladder — dragging an edge retunes the slice. Panels no longer poll the engine while invisible, the tube attack knob that changed nothing is gone, and a stored chain naming a retired stage keeps the operator's order instead of resetting it.
- **AetherTX — the transmit chain in one window (#5819).** The same shape for the transmit side: Gate, EQ, De-esser, Compressor, Tube, Exciter, Reverb and Final Output, with the stage column, page frame and profile machinery shared with AetherRX rather than copied. BYPASS, Record and Play move into the Settings dialog's Chain section, RN2 moves to the gate toolbar where it actually acts, and the compressor makeup becomes a focusable, keyboard-driven control that announces through accessibility. Channel-strip presets are retired; each saved one is split once into its transmit and receive halves on first open.
- A checked `QPushButton` under the modem chrome now has a visible state, so BYPASS, Record and Play show when they are pressed (#5846).

### Noise reduction and shared DSP

- **WDSP moves to 2.10 (#5686)**, fixing an upstream use-after-free on the channel-open path. The refresh costs about 8.8 MB of resident memory per RX channel because 2.10 instantiates NNR unconditionally; that was measured and ruled acceptable.
- **Neural Noise Reduction (NNR)** becomes the seventh client-side NR method: the full ten-control surface is exposed with pinned default markers (#5687), it builds without DeepFilterNet (#5707), managed Kiwi sources are no longer silent under it and the selection persists across restarts (#5708), and the stereo adapter is told the real 192 ms end-to-end latency on the 24 kHz path with the default strength corrected to match WDSP (#5709).
- **NR2 gains WDSP's psychoacoustic post-processing (#5703)** — the residual-and-noise blend that fills the dead gaps between syllables. Our port of `emnr.c` had no trace of it; it ships off, as upstream does.
- The minimum-phase FIR workspace — four `FFTW_PATIENT` plans per instance, 72 of them dead on a single channel open — is built only when minimum phase is on, for every backend (#5697).
- `WdspChannel` gains a real runtime start/stop, and `close()` no longer burns its full 100 ms timeout holding the FFTW setup lock (#5628). The five distinct WDSP processing failures are counted and logged instead of sharing one silent `continue` (#5738), and a transport sequence gap discards the partial panadapter frame rather than joining pre- and post-gap samples in one FFT window (#5744), both on HL2 and ANAN.
- **The S-meter reads WDSP's average, not its decaying peak-hold**, on both raw-IQ backends. On a steady carrier the two agree exactly, which is why every test-tone check passed while the band noise floor read 11–14 dB high (#5785).

### Maps and reporting

- **Global precipitation with regional radar backups (#5705).** An opt-in LibreWXR overlay with independently selectable NOAA, ECCC and EUMETNET OPERA regional feeds, an optional per-provider intensity legend and default-off coverage shading from 389 bundled sites. When an existing user enables the weather overlay, LibreWXR becomes the default primary; NOAA stays selectable on its own.
- WSJT-X "calling me" spots fall back to the station callsign when no DX cluster login is configured, compare case-insensitively, and strip hashed and portable notation (#5841).

### CW and Copy Assist

- **An optional DeepFist CW receive backend** lands behind `CwRxModel` (#5716). ggmorse remains the default and the sidetone decoder; DeepFist invents no confidence, pitch or speed and does not feed callsign spotting. `ENABLE_DEEPFIST_EXPERIMENT` stays off by default and no model weights ship.
- CW decoder parameter changes no longer race the decoding worker: GGMorse lives entirely on the worker and consumes one coherent pending configuration between frames (#5645).
- **Copy Assist stops taking the app down.** A GPU without room for the model fails the load and retries on CPU instead of dereferencing null in vendored whisper.cpp, and the default tier reads free GPU memory before picking `large-v3-turbo` (#5773). A fault inside device discovery or model load leaves flushed begin/end stage records in the log, and whisper/ggml warnings reach the log file (#5790). A model slower than real time drops audio at a bounded backlog and shows the dropped seconds instead of queueing forever (#5801).

### Panadapter, spectrum and GPU

- **Extended TNF** mirrors a tracking-notch band through the waterfall, the same affordance Extended Passband gives the filter, reachable from the TNF marker's menu and the pan overlay menu (#5679).
- The FFT average slider now reaches the model on a raw-spectrum backend, so it survives a pan rebuild (#5754).
- ANAN's panadapter crops its true edge instead of fading it, with the taper narrowed from 9% to 4% so the shipped droop correction is on screen (#5808), and ANAN regains its noise-floor auto-adjust — `panBinsAreAbsolute` is split out of `radioOwnsDbmScale`, which was answering two questions with one flag (#5726).
- Selecting the discrete GPU on a hybrid-graphics laptop under Wayland works: a GLX-only environment variable that selects nothing on EGL no longer vetoes the saved choice (#5809).

### Amplifiers and tuners

- **TGXL front-panel presentation, tune abort and tuner alerts (#5676).** Popped out or on the workspace canvas the tuner applet lays itself out like the device's own panel. From a capture of TunerGeniusDesk: `autotune` is a toggle, so TUNE becomes STOP while a tune runs, and the tuner's `M|<text>` alert channel is shown as a banner for as long as the device shows it.
- **PGXL front-panel presentation (#5694)** with per-port band, bias profile and source radio from the amplifier's direct status, and a **drive meter** on the amplifier panel from the `DRV` meter the radio was relaying all along; the relayed and direct forward-power and SWR feeds now have one owner instead of last-writer-wins, and MEffA gets a toggle (#5732).
- **The TGXL is metered from the device's own `peak`**, and both peripherals are polled at about 60 Hz while transmitting and 4 Hz while receiving. Voice at 60 W had been reading about 10 W because `fwd` sampled the gaps between syllables (#5845).
- The SPE LCD mirror stops blinking: display polling is paced from each reply, the idle gap shrinks to 250 ms, a rejected frame is re-requested promptly, and staleness gates only the front-panel key group rather than dimming the glass (#5542).
- The amplifier-meter members are declared outside the hidapi guard, so a build without hidapi compiles again (#5767).

### Hermes-Lite 2

- **The TX level stack.** The ALC only ever reduces, and the Mic Level slider becomes the operator's transmit level — the old loop applied up to 40 dB of upward makeup gain and lifted room noise level with the voice between words (#5646). Engine-generated audio keeps the level its generator chose and is not moved by the mic slider (#5647), and the host-modulated WSPR beacon defaults to −3 dBFS so it does not go out 18.6 dB down (#5651). The Phone panel shows the **ALC Gain** the radio reports, gated on the meter existing (#5636).
- **A WDSP TXA modulator (#5747), now the default (#5779).** ON8ST keyed it into a dummy load and onto an antenna on 2026-09-17, which is the condition `CMakeLists.txt` set for flipping `AETHER_HL2_TX_TXA` to ON; the in-tree phasing modulator remains one flag away. The phasing modulator's opposite-sideband suppression is now measured across the passband — 22 dB at 150 Hz on the DIGU/DIGL band, exactly the derived figure (#5741) — and the sideband gate measures the modulator rather than itself (#5810).
- **The modes this radio cannot transmit in are declared** — AM, SAM, DSB, FM, NFM, WBFM and DRM took the upper-sideband branch of a phasing SSB modulator, so selecting AM and keying put suppressed-carrier SSB on the air. Keying and TUNE now refuse in those modes (#5680). The backend also publishes the modes it actually demodulates, so RTTY, DFM and DSTR stop silently falling back to USB (#5755).
- **The wideband bandscope (endpoint 4)** is decoded and accounted for on the wire, behind a duty-cycle gate that is off by default (#5650), and **Tools → Wideband Bandscope…** shows one converter record on demand (#5675). **Automatic RF gain** drives on measured wideband headroom rather than the clip counter, per RFC #5535 — it ships off until the +20 dB LNA default can be reconciled with the arming baseline (#5652).
- **The dBm reference is derived**: full scale is +3 dBm at the antenna at 0 dB LNA gain, from the AD9866 datasheet and the input transformer and filter-board loss (#5753), and connect gain is clamped without changing the native −12…+48 dB range (#5752).
- **A zoom no longer silences the radio.** Pan-bandwidth chains are built on their own thread and installed on the I/O thread in one turn, instead of rebuilding inline where EP2 pacing starves and the gateware watchdog halts the stream (#5783).
- The S-meter no longer publishes the silence clocked in while transmit-muted: the tap is guarded during the over and for a settle window after the mute releases, so the needle neither dives on key-down nor on unkey (#5821). The ADC RMS is measured about the mean, so converter DC can no longer deflate the crest factor that tells broadband noise from a carrier (#5832).
- A declined automatic-gain arm explains itself where the operator is — checkbox state, a card, and the accessible channel — on every route to an arm, not only in the log; on a fresh install the +20 dB LNA default is always refused, so this was the first thing a new operator hit (#5825).
- The link-stats getter carries liveness, and the gap, jitter and RTT figures reach the `liveness` verb (#5786). Documentation catches up on the TX positive-edges rule (#5710) and the retired 5 ms ALC attack (#5737), and the cadence test owns its includes (#5735).

### Flex, Icom and ANAN

- A TCP disconnect mid-status-line no longer leaves the parser buffer for the next session to fabricate a response from, and model command callbacks expire on disconnect (#5653).
- Concurrent Icom Keychain reads coalesce behind one QtKeychain job, so a saved startup route no longer raises three authorization prompts (#5674). Radio certification's Icom Persist snapshots carry confirmation provenance, and TX evidence no longer turns unsupported meters into results (#5516).
- **ANAN-G2 ships DDC0 droop-correction defaults derived from the Saturn gateware** — the CIC and 1024-tap FIR are fully specified in the FPGA sources, so an unswept radio gets a corrected FFT on first connect (#5549).

### Recording, DVK, mailbox and persistence

- QSO recordings claim their filename with exclusive creation and never truncate an existing WAV (#5644); incomplete writes are reported and the recorder stops safely instead of advertising a broken file (#5654); and recording is rate-aware, fixing each WAV at 24 or 48 kHz with playback that validates the real format (#5720).
- DVK uploads no longer queue duplicate bytes on partial socket drains (#5668), and a failed or cancelled DVK export preserves the existing destination file (#5669).
- The PMS mailbox writes atomically and says `SAVED` only when it did (#5666).
- **A healthy settings database is never quarantined for a permissions error** — recovery now requires actual corruption evidence, and an unwritable store is detected at open rather than at the first save (#5639). Stale profile-transfer callbacks cannot tear down a replacement operation (#5638).

### Audio, TCI and devices

- A VFO B request from one TCI client no longer retunes the slice another client operates; satellite full duplex is unchanged (#5681). TCI receive audio preserves producer rates and stereo and negotiates only the published 8/12/24/48 kHz rates (#5722).
- **The Windows CW sidetone defaults back to `QAudioSink`** (#5719), and the PortAudio heap corruption behind the Windows connect crash — a one-token upstream bug that frees a stack address while enumerating DAX endpoints — is patched at build time (#5748).
- The Audio pane's device lists follow the platform instead of a build-time snapshot (#5781), and MIDI and serial selectors resolve choices by identity rather than by row, with a Refresh button for the Peripherals serial ports (#5787).
- The FlexControl knob is treated as a host device, so its settings stay reachable on non-Flex radios (#5799).

### Settings, Radio Setup and menus

- **A three-state control doctrine and availability registry (#5658)** — unavailable, inactive and active — so unsupported controls stay visible, disabled and carry a reason. Nine Radio Setup surfaces dim with reasons, and TX Band Settings and Inhibit during TUNE gain accessible status tips.
- **Tools → Calibrate AGC-T** joins the menu as a second entry point to the noise-floor calibration (#5757), placed under Clear ATU Memories with a shorter label (#5836).
- Selecting a Radio Setup page on macOS no longer crashes accessibility queries: navigation rows are hidden only when their state changes and the layout is settled on our own call stack (#5838). Radio Setup stops inventing `Region: USA` on a radio that has none (#5848), and the Connect panel is no longer stranded on the previous Space when the main window is full screen (#5791).
- A KiwiSDR receive antenna shows the right window again: `zoom_cap` is kept off the `zoom_max` start scale on v1.900+ shared waterfalls (#5657).

### Backend seam

- **Health that survives disconnection**: an `OfflineHealthSource` answers "is another client holding this radio", "is it reachable" and "what is its PA temperature" when no session exists, the verb #5414 was missing (#5642).
- The construction-time mic push is gated on `hostModulates`, not on "not Flex" (#5643).

### Headless engine (aetherd)

- Desktop TX producer ownership survives queued work: a CAT stop releases only that client's key, and an old callback cannot acquire a newer input or release its transmission (#5659).
- **Credential-bound TX grants and qualified Flex PTT handoff (#5830).** Independent clients bind to actors on the `TxCoordinator` behind explicit `--allow-local-tx` and a native-vault credential authority that fails closed; grants carry separate continuous-operation, lifetime and keepalive limits. Software PTT handoff supports Flex radios on SmartSDR TCP API 1.4 over LAN, hardware-tested on a FLEX-6700. Startup remains disarmed, and SmartLink, other families, TUNE/ATU/CW and transmit audio transport are not enabled.

### Automation and MQTT

- `aethersdr/radio/state` publishes the RF drive, the ceiling it scales against and whether the drive is confirmed radio state (#5733).

### Project and packaging

- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` lose the machine-specific paths and distro assumptions that only ever held on one maintainer's machine, and the roadmap is brought current (#5739).
- Skills: `/pr-land` drives an accepted PR to merge with every judgment call put to the maintainer (#5746), audits the aetherd ratchets and pins EB3's vendor vocabulary (#5760), and gates on whether the green is still current after #5516 merged on a stale one (#5765); `/papercuts` and `/fb` add bridge-verified issue triage and bug fixing (#5812).
- The `[full-suite]` bot issue carries the failing assertions above the log tail (#5795). Three tests are corrected rather than deleted: `tgxl_docked_parity` asserts maximality (#5736), the WSPR tag check stops pinning an argument list (#5763), and the watchdog fixture declares `twoToneGenerator` (#5772).
- `jurplel/install-qt-action` moves to 4.4.0 (#5826) and `docker/build-push-action` to 7.4.0 (#5827).

## [v26.9.3] — 2026-09-13

### A Tools-first menu bar, live map overlays and APRS digipeating · a vendor-neutral backend seam underneath

86 merged changes from 16 human contributors, AetherClaude and one Dependabot update within that total. The menu bar is reorganized around what operators actually reach for, and the rest of the operator-facing half adds weather and night-lights overlays to PSK Reporter, a WIDE1-1 fill-in digipeater, clock-aligned waterfall markers and the Runtime Monitor Overview. The structural half routes slice, capability and transmit paths through the `IRadioBackend` seam and continues the headless-engine and audio rate-domain work.

### Menu bar and VFO defaults

- **A Tools-first menu bar (#5595).** The top level becomes
  `File · Settings · Profiles · Tools · View · Help`. Operating tools that were
  scattered across File, Settings, View and Help — PSK Reporter, Memory,
  Waveforms, Radio Health, the modem and KiwiSDR setup, guarded tuner
  operations — collect under **Tools**, which sits ahead of **View** because
  operators reach for them more often than for display settings. Existing
  actions and handlers are reused, so shortcuts and lifecycle behavior are
  unchanged; what changes is where things are found. Radio-sensitive entries
  start disabled and track connection and capability changes, `Start SWR Scan…`
  and `Pre-tune ATU Bands…` are marked as TX-keying, and Radio Setup keeps its
  Qt Preferences role so macOS still presents it under the application menu.
  The obsolete Settings placeholder loop that reported "not yet implemented"
  for actions that in fact worked is removed.
- **Global VFO appearance defaults (#5595).** View gains **VFO Marker Size**
  (Off, 1 px, 3 px) and **VFO Filter Edge** (Show, Hide), stored atomically as
  one feature-owned `VfoDisplayDefaults` document. Changing either updates live
  VFOs without overwriting per-slice overrides, and an absent or malformed value
  falls back to the historical 3 px marker with visible filter edges.

### Maps and reporting

- **NOAA weather radar with playback** overlays current and recent radar on PSK Reporter maps (#5477).
- **NASA city lights** adds a night-lights basemap layer (#5479).
- A dark map style with brightness controls joins the existing styles (#5495).
- Map controls move into a left sidebar instead of competing with the map itself (#5493).
- NASA and NWS tile requests retry on transient failures rather than leaving the layer blank (#5485).
- The GPU spectrum path no longer takes the PSK map with it on macOS; the map stays on a raster viewport (#5623).

### Waterfall, spectrum and monitoring

- **Clock-aligned waterfall time markers** draw thin UTC-labelled lines at Off, 15 s, 30 s, 1, 5, 10 or 15 minute intervals, aligned to clock boundaries and pinned to their captured rows through scrolling, pause and resize. Off remains the default and the choice persists per panadapter slot (#5538).
- **Runtime Monitor Overview** adds CPU Total, Max Thread, resident memory and GUI Tick Lag cards over 1 min / 5 min / 15 min / 1 h ranges, with charts for CPU, memory, the top five threads and tick lag (#5427). One timeframe selector is now shared across the Runtime Monitor tabs (#5531).
- The GPU FFT trace reports an honest width — 1.0 px by default, with a 0.5 px WAVE scope floor (#5557).
- NR2 keeps its noise estimate across the TX→RX edge instead of re-converging after every transmission (#5364).

### Digital modes

- **APRS WIDE1-1 fill-in digipeater** arrives as an AetherModem tab. It substitutes MYCALL with the H bit on the first matching unused hop, requires the shared 1200-baud profile, a valid callsign and explicit per-session arming, and never restores arming from settings. Wide-area WIDEn-N hop decrementing is not included (#5562).
- HF 300 decoding is corrected — the correlator lowpass was narrower than the tone shift — and `HdlcCodec` handles back-to-back frames (#5494).
- WSJT-X UDP spot decodes land on the reporting instance's band rather than another instance's (#5564).
- A FreeDV Reporter double-click tunes and forces RADE (#5512).
- The D-STAR tab is hidden on radios without waveform support (#5556), and the RTTY decoder pane stays closed once dismissed (#5379).

### Receivers

- **Web-888 joins the KiwiSDR receive path as its own receiver family.** Saved receivers keep their family across restarts, legacy entries default to KiwiSDR, and CSV import accepts an optional `RECEIVER_TYPE` field (#5530). Waterfall start scale now derives from the server's `zoom_max` (#5529).
- ANAN-G2 gains live DDC rate changes — a zoom notch no longer rebuilds the whole Protocol 2 session — plus multi-DDC encoding and per-port demultiplexing on the wire. The codec is multi-DDC capable; the backend still drives one DDC (#5547). DDC0 edge droop is compensated from an in-app calibration (#5357).
- RTL-SDR gains a bounded receiver lifecycle foundation (#5590) and preserves device identity in preparation for slice persistence (#5473).
- A shared-capture RF admission policy requires every receiver's guarded passband to fit the shared capture before a tune, filter, mode or rate change is accepted. The helper is not yet wired to a live backend (#5472).

### CW, ATU and transmit

- Break-in delay holds against the radio's QSK-floor walk when the speed changes (#5288), and CW keying and TUNE now interlock in both directions (#5513).
- The Phone/CW mic level persists across launches (#5505).
- ATU tune failures appear in the status bar (#5239), a disabled Pre-tune explains why (#5539), and ATU starts are gated on the backend seam like every other keying intent (#5560).
- The PortAudio CW sidetone sink compiles on Windows (#5201).

### Hermes-Lite 2

- **Stream-free telemetry** reads the radio's own telemetry when the IQ stream cannot supply it (#5414), and TX:ALCGAIN publishes the gain the HL2 ALC is applying (#5506).
- An RQST/ACK state machine keeps one request outstanding, echo-matched and quarantined (#5627).
- The AGC ceiling is referred to the dB reference (#5625), and WDSP's `RXA_ADC_PK` is paired with the pre-DDC clip flag (#5626).
- The SWR detector is linearized and its noise gate re-derived (#5521); `setBandFilter()`'s stale CONFIG one-shot is dropped (#5511).
- An operator write ends the pin and records the band even when the value has not moved (#5466).
- Documentation catches up: the backend DSP read-back is documented (#5465), Hermes §13 Tier 1 is closed (#5621), and two stale claims — clip count at idle and the TCI audio path — are corrected (#5533).

### Flex and Icom

- Panadapter and slice capacity come from the radio rather than a compiled-in assumption (#5603), and manual squelch reconciles correctly after a band recall (#5508).
- The primary Split paths are gated on a command plane (#5523).
- Icom retains squelch intent and waterfall speed across restarts (#5514), and a refused tune no longer reads as a successful one (#5373).

### Stability

- Spectrum and VFO menu shutdown crashes are fixed (#5567), nested dialog lifetimes are guarded and safe menu owners audited (#5596), and ProfileTransfer no longer crashes on cleanup re-entry (#5617).
- The Aetherial strip reopens after minimize (#5366), and the connection dialog reopens when startup auto-connect gives up (#5368).
- The diversity master flag moves to the right (#5470).

### Firmware and Radio Setup

- Firmware upload byte accounting is corrected and unconfirmed outcomes are reported as such (#5597).
- Closing Radio Setup mid-upload now asks for confirmation (#5606).

### Backend seam

- **The `IRadioBackend` threading and lifetime contract is pinned by tests**, closing the rule-5 gap those tests found (#5573).
- Ordinary RX slice lifecycle routes through the backend seam (#5471).
- Backends announce capability revisions — Flex, HL2 and RTL (#5602) — family verbs are gated on the declared namespace (#5618), and the capability-bool population and raw command plane are frozen in CI (#5619).
- `AGENTS.md` carries a temporary pointer to the backend-review meta-issue (#5555).

### Headless engine (aetherd)

- Opt-in local connection control arrives behind an explicit grant (#5458), followed by guarded local slice frequency control (#5550).
- Stage 3 adds capability-qualified local receive controls — mode, filter, audio gain and mute, panadapter center and bandwidth — with bounded read-only telemetry. The daemon stays observe-only unless `--allow-local-control` is passed, and no transmit methods or grants are added (#5563).
- Stage 4 begins with an engine-local `TxCoordinator` routing primary desktop transmit intent. The multi-client arbiter and daemon transmission are not part of this release (#5591).

### Audio rate domains

- A typed producer PCM contract and compatibility adapters land as A1 of RFC #5468 (#5598).
- Optional NR rate domains are preserved as its A2 prerequisite (#5604), and AudioEngine queueing, processing and output become rate-aware (#5605).

### Automation and bridge

- The bridge can read and force-show item-view cell tooltips (#5534).
- The bridge token is minted from the CSPRNG and the async start reconciled (#5105).
- Owned Windows apps stop without SIGKILL (#5592), and local TCI clients are logged with the process behind them (#5130).
- Radio certification gains Persist diagnostics and FFT readback provenance (#5500).
- `ulanzi-start`/`ulanzi-stop` work on Windows and Linux, and a query that cannot be answered says so (#5305).

### Project and packaging

- CI: dependency caches save on main, Windows Qt installs via aqt, and tags are swept (#5552); one compiler cache is kept per prefix with Linux ccache capped at 1500 MB (#5551); py7zr is pinned for the aqt venvs and CodeQL TRAP caching is off (#5553); Actions caches belonging to closed PRs are swept (#5009); Qt is reinstalled when a cache hit restores an incomplete tree (#5632); Static checks is documented as required (#5633); the Aether-gate mirror workflow is removed (#5631).
- MSIX packaging preserves production release versions (#5467).
- The in-tree control-surface plugins are removed (#5600), and `redactPii()` coverage and tests are brought up to date with current log sites (#5481).
- `actions/download-artifact` moves to 8.0.1 (#5609).

## [v26.9.2] — 2026-09-06

### New receivers, multi-band skimming and station control

67 merged changes from 15 human contributors and AetherClaude, plus two Dependabot updates within that total, expand receive options and multi-band skimming while improving station peripherals, CW, Icom and Hermes-Lite 2 reliability.

### New receivers and multi-band skimming

- **Four concurrent TCI DAX IQ subscriptions — several CW skimmers through one TCI server** let compatible Flex setups feed several skimmers through one TCI server. Receivers on the same panadapter share its IQ stream; four independent band spectra require four panadapters (#4951).
- **Experimental ANAN-G2 reception** adds openHPSDR Protocol 2 discovery, a single receive path, spectrum and audio, with live tuning and zoom. This phase is receive-only; transmit remains a future phase (#5143).
- **Experimental RTL-SDR USB reception** adds a single slice and panadapter with basic AM, FM, SSB and CW demodulation on builds with the required RTL libraries. Availability varies by package; selectable sharp passband filtering is not yet implemented (#4862).

### Amplifiers, wattmeters and operator workflow

- **SPE floating front panel** adds a live amplifier LCD mirror and guarded front-panel keys (#5393).
- **TelePost LP-100A support** displays the wattmeter's readings over local serial or a serial-to-network proxy. This first version is read-only (#5320).
- Runtime Monitor gains process-memory history (#5397).
- PGXL and TGXL startup synchronization improves initial status presentation (#5337, #5339). PA current appears when PTT originates at the radio (#5307).
- The connection panel stays visible at startup (#5334), CTCSS choices are easier to read (#5259), and radio-specific settings and Flex-only zoom controls are gated to compatible backends (#5299, #5166).

### KiwiSDR

- The public-receiver browser reads its directory from the AetherSDR CDN mirror (#5445).
- The directory-mirror Worker is included in the repository, and stale directory data is advisory so operators can continue browsing available receivers (#5449).

### CW

- Client-side recordings capture sent CW instead of microphone input (#5278).
- CWX sidetone follows the keyer's scheduled edges (#5129).
- The P/CW pane gains APF toggle and level controls (#4883).
- APF wheel input is ignored while APF is disabled (#5163).
- CW settings remain stable on backends that do not echo them (#5380).

### Audio and Flex controls

- Controller AGC-T input reaches the correct level control with AGC off (#5387).
- Active-slice ALC and TX waveform meter routing are corrected (#5344).
- Ulanzi TCI volume handling now converts the wire's dB values correctly (#5389).

### Icom

- **Wire-based model identification and optional wake on connect** replace reliance on an editable network nickname. Wake defaults off and uses model-specific profiles for IC-705, IC-7300MK2 and IC-9700; the radio's network interface must remain reachable (#5438).
- Durable memory ownership and synchronized recall are restored (#5328).
- RX filter preset identity, skirt mapping and recall are corrected (#5363).
- Background polling no longer starves TX meters (#5435).
- Finite AX.25 transmit audio is preserved over RS-BA1 (#5311).
- IC-705 GPS location and NTP controls are added (#5146).
- Unavailable tuner controls are dimmed (#5292).
- IC-705 power gauges use the appropriate QRP scale (#5369).

#### Native controls and meters (#5436)

A broad IC-7300MK2 control cleanup makes the UI follow the radio's supported settings, ranges and native readback. Model-specific mappings remain separate so these corrections do not impose MK2 behavior on other Icom radios.

- **TX bandwidth:** correct the high/low cutoff encoding and decoding, including the 300 Hz and 500 Hz low-cut selections. On the MK2, the native `0x30` value correctly represents 100–2900 Hz. IC-705 and MK2 retain their own setting addresses and cutoff tables.
- **CW speed:** use the MK2's supported 6–48 WPM range. When capabilities change, the slider and numeric editor reconcile together without sending an unintended radio command.
- **CW pitch:** follow the MK2's 5 Hz steps so button presses and radio readback agree instead of displaying unsupported intermediate values.
- **Squelch:** keep the threshold usable in CW and data modes, preserving the radio's value across mode changes rather than treating squelch as a voice-only control.
- **Unsupported controls:** disable AGC threshold, AGC Off, AM carrier and VOX delay where the backend cannot implement them. Selecting an unavailable AGC mode is refused instead of silently substituting another mode.
- **Repeater controls:** disable unsupported MK2 offset magnitude and direction controls, and refuse unsupported commands and polling. XFC remains available.
- **Tune in CW/CW-R:** refuse Tune before changing power, generating a tone or requesting PTT. Stop remains available if a tune operation is already active.
- **Radio readback:** periodically reconcile CW speed, CW pitch, squelch and TX bandwidth, allowing the client to adopt radio-side changes and restored settings.
- **Meter precision and scales:** preserve fractional power readings and present native ALC and compression scales. Fractional watts retain the radio's reporting resolution; they do not imply greater measurement accuracy. ALC continues to follow the active slice, and changing meter units clears incompatible animation state while normal unkey decay is retained.
- **Automation and accessibility:** expose the existing RF gain slider by name and consistently reject disabled or unreachable combo-box selections. RF gain's protocol and range are unchanged.
- **Meter diagnostics:** add bounded, read-only observation windows for delivery age and native peaks, including multiple samples arriving within the same millisecond.

### Hermes-Lite 2 reliability and diagnostics

- HL2 power gauges use the appropriate 5 W scale (#5369).
- Per-band gain survives startup and temporary overrides (#5402), and the HL2 IO Board gains band-following amplifier control (#5362).
- DSP setup is bounded and logged; diagnostics expose actual DSP configuration and connection progress (#5415, #5401, #5416).
- TX FIFO status decoding follows the gateware, repeated ADC-overload warnings are rate-limited, and spectrum FFTW operations are serialized (#5398, #5381, #5424).
- The Hermes troubleshooting guide preserves the WDSP wisdom cache during isolation and updates resolved defect status (#5417, #5383).

### Headless engine, packaging and project quality

- **aetherd Stage 3 groundwork** adds the versioned protocol boundary, typed observations, per-session authorization and an observe-only discovery catalogue. Authenticated radio control, transmit grants and a replacement desktop client are not part of this release (#5109, #5391, #5434, #5455).
- Linux gains CPack DEB/RPM configuration and an optional system SQLite build (#5155, #4736). Homebrew header precedence and MinGW compatibility are corrected (#5399, #5375, #5377).
- Windows Store packaging includes fuller symbols and upload handling, a corrected Store CLI pin, and an explicit developer-flight submission workflow (#5345, #5388, #5346).
- The full test suite runs on pushes to main; sanitizer configuration and suppressions are repaired, two previously unregistered tests join execution, and eight intermittent tests are removed (#5412, #5405, #5411, #5419, #5421, #5101, #5452).
- Review guidance, reviewer attribution and release metadata are synchronized; committed build logs are removed, and two GitHub Actions dependencies are updated (#5358, #5459, #5325, #5453, #5439, #5440).

## [v26.9.1] — 2026-08-29

### Globe maps, antenna control and operator polish · sharper Flex behavior · deeper evidence-gated Icom support

53 merged changes from 12 contributors put the broad operator experience first:
PSK Reporter gains a globe projection, Green Heron antenna and rotator control
arrives as a native applet, System Info exposes live thread and log views, and
the panadapter, RTTY, CW, sidetone and automation workflows all receive focused
improvements.

Flex-specific fixes restore band-stack recall, PA temperature and TNF removal
behavior. Networked Icom support closes the cycle with model-gated controls and
telemetry, stronger IC-9700 presentation and scaling, safer reconnect/TX
lifecycle behavior, read-only radio memories, DTCS and multi-radio NAT support.

### New features and operator workflow

- **Green Heron Everyware antenna control (#5209).** A native GHE applet controls
  compatible antenna switches and rotators.
- **Optional globe projection for PSK Reporter (#5273).** Operators can switch
  from the flat map to a global view of received reports.
- **System Info Threads and Logs tabs (#5246)** make runtime diagnosis available
  inside the app.
- **RTTY decoder sensitivity (#5132)** is adjustable directly from the decoder
  bar.
- Panadapter button-rail collapse state now persists (#5221), and the active band
  is highlighted in the spectrum overlay (#5236).
- Connect-time enumeration no longer overwrites the radio's active slice (#4985).
- Explicit PortAudio sidetone selections no longer get captured by a shorter
  device-name match (#5135).
- CW Zero Beat mirrors correctly for CWL and clears stale pitch estimates
  (#5224); iambic keyer edges no longer echo back into the sidetone gate (#5128).
- Radio sharing is single-sourced (#5264), unsupported Flex-only controls dim
  off-Flex (#5266), and missing command planes fail visibly (#5265).
- Demo mode now reaches its backend through the capability extension namespace
  (#5268).

### Automation and project quality

- Automation adds FM repeater controls (#5104), text-view inspection (#5136),
  momentary key events (#5137), and combo-box popup actions (#5144).
- Flex-only automation verbs now refuse unsupported backends instead of falsely
  reporting success (#5267).
- Synthetic transport tests are separated by verification layer (#5232), every
  registered test receives a default 300-second timeout (#5272), and the test
  boundary conventions are documented (#5255).
- The capability field map and stale comments are brought back into sync (#5269),
  and the project gains a repeatable issue-fit, governance and code-quality PR
  review workflow (#5245).

### FlexRadio and TCI fixes

- Band shortcuts once again restore Flex band-stack state (#4967).
- Flex PA temperature returns to the status bar on capable radios (#5295).
- TNF removal status now removes the notch instead of recreating it (#5314).
- TCI `cw_macros` messages no longer append the receiver index to macro text
  (#5153).

### Networked Icom

- **Radio-authoritative memories and signaling.** Read-only IC-9700 radio memory
  integration (#5283), synchronized dial lock (#5261), capability-gated IC-705
  and IC-9700 DTCS (#5294), IC-9700 CTCSS TX/RX (#5203), and model-gated
  extended repeater readback (#5161) follow each model's attested surface.
- **More accurate IC-9700 controls and telemetry.** Supply voltage (#5170), PA
  drain current (#5238), continuous compression (#5240), LAN MOD Phone level
  (#5211), RF power scaling (#5208), RF Gain/preamp presentation (#5189), and
  declared VHF/UHF bands (#5186) now reach the UI correctly.
- Unsupported PA temperature (#5172), Main Fan (#5174), DEXP (#5181), and TX
  cutoff controls (#5184) remain hidden; voltage waits for real telemetry
  (#5176), and Phone/CW level clears before its first sample (#5179).
- **Safer network and TX lifecycle.** TUNE owns its carrier (#5218), SWR and ALC
  survive isolated minimum replies (#5216), RX Controls stay subscribed across
  reconnect (#5220), and WSJT-X TCI unkey handling gains incident telemetry
  (#5274).
- Custom UDP port triplets support multi-radio NAT (#5230), SpotHub spots flow
  through the client model (#5228), and RS-BA1 handshake failures identify both
  the target and likely cause (#5303).

## [v26.8.4] — 2026-08-22

### Evidence-backed Icom · client-timed HL2 CW · faster PSK Reporter maps · steadier audio, MIDI and TCI

48 commits since v26.8.3. **Icom support now grows by model and evidence, not
assumption:** typed profiles for the IC-705, IC-7300MK2 and IC-9700 gate the
radio's actual controls, calibration and RF decks; unknown models fail closed.
That foundation brings radio-authoritative repeater tone/duplex/XFC, real
IF-width/PBT and TX-cut readback, the network radio name, CW text keying, WFM,
correct VHF/UHF limits and bounded IC-9700 CI-V recovery.

The **Hermes-Lite 2 gains client-timed CW transmit and persistence**, scheduled
key edges now drive sidetone/trace/netcw consistently, and the default PortAudio
sidetone path works. PSK Reporter renders more coverage with less overhead and
smooth pinch-to-zoom; NR2, the float32 microphone path, MIDI profile handling,
TCI, Workspace Canvas and several controller/UI seams receive focused fixes.

### Networked Icom

- **Evidence-backed model capability profiles (#5151).** IC-705, IC-7300MK2
  and IC-9700 behavior is described by independently attested facets instead of
  scattered address checks. Unknown and unprofiled radios hide unsupported
  controls and telemetry instead of borrowing another model's commands or
  calibration.
- **Real RX filters, twin PBT and TX cuts (#5076).** The app reads the radio's
  actual IF width, keeps filter slot/width/shift separate, writes only
  model-supported TX edges and publishes the radio's readback.
- **FM repeater tone, duplex, offset and momentary XFC (#5140).** State is
  read-first and profile-gated, recalled in radio-safe order, and XFC always
  releases on hide, deactivation, capability change or disconnect.
- **Network Radio Name in the status bar (#5148).** A custom RS-BA1 radio name
  is kept distinct from canonical model, hostname and callsign.
- **CI-V CW text keying as CWK (#5113)** and a focus fix that prevents incoming
  CWK updates from stealing the VFO editor (#5134).
- **The radio's own mode vocabulary reaches the UI (#5106),** making WFM
  selectable where the model advertises it.
- **Correct RF decks and tune guards:** 2 m/70 cm are admitted on the IC-705
  (#5108), and IC-9700 band power limits are modelled explicitly (#5117).
- **Hardened lifecycle and IC-9700 recovery (#5145).** Cancelled scheduler work
  receives terminal outcomes, stale-session frames cannot publish state, and a
  confirmed IC-9700 CI-V stall gets bounded serial-stream recovery before a
  full reconnect.
- Icom logging now registers its categories and records every CI-V frame
  (#4965); the scheduler-safe trace regression was fixed (#5046).

### CW and Hermes-Lite 2

- **Client-timed HL2 CW transmit and persistence (#5061).** Host-scheduled key
  edges drive Protocol 1 CW safely, and client-owned CW operating state returns
  after restart.
- First-connect setup is presented reliably and test FFTW planning is bounded
  (#5062).
- Scheduled key instants now flow to sidetone, trace and netcw (#4942), and late
  edges shift the sidetone anchor forward rather than being clamped (#4934).
- PortAudio's real default-device path is reachable for the default sidetone
  selection (#5085), and CWX macro rows remain readable at minimum window
  height (#5125).

### Audio and noise reduction

- Microphone capture stays float32 through the 48 kHz voice strip (#5017).
- TX-accumulator clears are serialized on the AudioEngine thread (#5095).
- NR2 recovers from residual noise when AGC-T changes (#5045), and RN2 frame
  accumulation is unified (#5039).
- Automation proof modes now exercise RN2 more completely (#5043).

### PSK Reporter and the panadapter

- PSK Reporter map coverage and responsiveness improve through batched marker
  and path rendering, wrapped-map geometry and live-update work (#5110).
- Smooth trackpad pinch-to-zoom reaches the map (#5103).
- DIGL is no longer misclassified as RTTY, restoring the normal carrier marker
  and removing meaningless mark/space cues (#5167).
- Duplicate pan wiring callbacks are removed (#5038).

### Controllers, MIDI and TCI

- macOS Ulanzi input no longer seizes unrelated trackpads (#5147).
- AetherControl gains a direct Settings link for FlexControl configuration
  (#5157).
- MIDI profile Save reports its real outcome (#5127); dotted profile names and
  paths round-trip safely (#5083); the app's own Pitch Bend export re-imports
  (#5054); and SmartSDR `.map` files translate direct band/mode selection
  (#5053).
- TCI starts only after readiness, echoes start/stop correctly (#5082), and no
  longer double-broadcasts `vfo:` on channel 0 (#5088).

### App workflow and automation

- Workspace Canvas pan layouts reflow correctly after surface changes (#5152).
- Slider hover events no longer leave stale pixels at fractional UI scale
  (#4923).
- MainWindow disconnects the global focus-change signal before member teardown
  (#4927).
- PHONE low/high TX cuts accept exact typed values while preserving radio
  readback (#5064).
- The automation bridge gains `doubleClick` and `doubleClickAt` (#5069).
- Accessibility announcement tests skip only where the platform has no
  accessibility backend (#4949).

### Diagnostics, documentation and CI

- Startup logs and support bundles record CPU SIMD, RAM and GPU capability
  inventory (#4988).
- MCP token guidance keeps `AETHER_MCP_TOKEN` out of persistent configuration
  (#5158).
- HL2 documentation and tools move into their maintained repository homes
  (#5035).
- The Linux gate runs `midi_settings_test` (#5025); digital-voice ASan opt-in no
  longer breaks TSan (#4947); and release signing archives the tag build rather
  than `main` (#5029).

## [v26.8.3] — 2026-08-16

### The workspace canvas · a command scheduler for Icom · HL2 gains a noise blanker and a real BFO · VK3AMP amplifiers · the TX voice chain moves to 48 kHz float

53 commits since v26.8.2. The headline is a **new shell**: the **workspace
canvas** (RFC #4887) lands complete, all seven phases across four PRs — pans and
applets become freely placed, resizable, layered items on a canvas that can span
several top-level windows, with named workspaces, full-recall switching and
radio-profile bindings. It is **experimental and off by default**: an operator who
never opens the View menu sees the application they had, and an install that never
enables it never gains a settings key.

**Icom** moved from "a backend that works" to "a backend with a command plane".
Every meter read, control write, reconciliation poll and PTT transition now goes
through one **CI-V scheduler** with explicit priorities, coalescing and stale-reply
rejection — written because a delayed PTT-OFF reply arriving after a newer PTT-ON
was cutting transmit audio. Alongside it: the **IC-7300MK2** control surface
completed against live hardware (18 operator-visible defects), **RS-BA1 lease
renewal** fixed at the 255→256 sequence boundary that was freezing the panadapter,
and a connect path that **asks the radio for its own CI-V address** instead of
assuming the IC-705's. **WSPR** now transmits from an Icom — confirmed on the air
with 20 PSK Reporter reception reports across the continental US and Alaska.

The **Hermes-Lite 2** gained a working **NB** button — WDSP's impulse blanker
running host-side on the raw IQ, where it is the only place it can run at all — and
a **real BFO**, so a CW passband finally straddles the marker instead of sitting
where a USB filter would. Its AGC mode and threshold now survive a restart, and a
TCI/DAX client's own level control is no longer normalised away by the host speech
ALC.

Rounding it out: the **VK3AMP** amplifier joins ACOM and SPE as a supported
peripheral; the **TX voice chain moves to a pinned 48 kHz float** path with a
single high-quality rate conversion; **DAX RX grows to 8 channels** on a FLEX-6700;
a **multi-hour Windows transmit crash** traced to a 2 GiB microphone backlog is
closed; and **CAT band changes finally bring the panadapter with them**.

### The workspace canvas

- **Canvas core, persistence and Classic migration (#4900).** RFC #4887 phases 1
  and 2, with no behaviour change — nothing is mounted and nothing is migrated at
  runtime. Placement is stored as **fractions of the canvas**, never pixels, so a
  layout authored on a 3840×1600 display restores in proportion on a 1920×1080
  laptop; rect edges are rounded independently rather than origin+size, so two
  items sharing a normalized edge land on the same pixel column at every canvas
  size. Persistence is one station-scoped key, one writer, one atomic
  whole-document write — replacing a dozen independent keys across three schemas
  with no single writer, where a shutdown path that skipped one restored a
  *mixture* of two layouts. A newer schema is refused rather than rewritten from
  this build's understanding.

- **Applets on the canvas — live drag, resize, snapping, escape hatches
  (#4941).** Phases 3–5. The title bar streams the gesture and the item follows the
  cursor; a canvas-owned frame masked to an 8 px border band carries eight resize
  grips so everything inside still clicks through to the applet. Snapping covers
  peer edges/centres and canvas edges at 8 px with painted guides, plus a
  normalized 96×54 grid with its own gentler magnet — peer edges beat the grid even
  when the grid line is nearer. Escape hatches: undo last placement, tidy, reset to
  Classic, per-item return/front/back. **Edit Layout mode** (a field request) gives
  the canvas two postures — locked by default, so operating the station never
  brushes the arranging machinery.

- **Named workspaces, full recall, profile bindings and pop-out import (#4964).**
  Phase 6. A workspace remembers *which applets are open*, not just where things
  sit. Three creation paths (from current layout, from Classic, from blank), CRUD
  with document-owned identity, and radio-profile bindings that switch the
  workspace when a bound global profile is recalled. Import pop-outs docks every
  floating container and pan at a rect mapped from its window geometry — the
  recovery path for a stale floating-pan configuration.

- **Additional canvas windows (#4971).** Phase 7. A workspace can span top-level
  windows, and every item moves between surfaces through a right-click **Move to ▸**
  menu. Closing a canvas window **hides** it — items stay recorded and return
  exactly on reopen; "Remove window" is the destructive path. Live cross-window
  drag is deliberately deferred: a cross-top-level reparent is the #2495/#4617/#4319
  crash lineage, and this phase routes it through one safe path instead. The schema
  needed nothing — `surfaces[]` shipped in phase 2 and had round-tripped ever since.

- **The palette greys undetected hardware instead of erasing it (#4968).** A field
  report from an 8600: the **Amplifiers** category vanished from Add widget ▸. The
  catalog is snapshotted once in MainWindow's constructor, before any radio
  connects, so filtering on hardware availability erased seven applets — TUN, AMP,
  ACOM, SPE, Demo Noise, Antenna Genius and ShackSwitch — permanently, and dropped
  them from workspace recall too. Availability is a live question and is now
  answered at menu-build time.

- **Minimal mode and canvas mode hand off cleanly (#4980).** Entering minimal mode
  from the canvas showed **no widgets at all** — minimal reparents the applet panel,
  which in canvas mode is empty. Entering now disables the canvas synchronously
  inside the same user action, and leaving restores it; Ctrl+M round-trips with the
  arrangement intact. Minimal mode is also registered as a shortcut action, so it is
  reachable from MIDI and the automation bridge — nothing could drive it
  programmatically before, which is exactly why the collision escaped every
  automated pass.

### Icom

- **A CI-V command scheduler (#5006).** The first production scheduler from
  #4983: one ordered command plane above `IcomSession::sendCiv()`, replacing
  independent direct sends from meter, control, startup, reconciliation and PTT
  producers. Dispatches are paced into 25 ms slots with one reply-bearing
  transaction in flight, prioritised emergency-unkey → operator → PTT → active
  meter → control → maintenance, with duplicate reads and rapid writes coalesced by
  semantic register. The load-bearing case: a pre-key PTT poll requested `OFF`, the
  client issued `ON`, and the delayed `OFF` reply arrived afterwards — treating it
  as current state stopped transmit audio before the radio's real `ON` confirmation.
  Stale completions after a newer intent are now rejected. Icom-only by design;
  Flex and HL2 behaviour is untouched.

- **IC-7300MK2 remote controls, meters and certification (#4981).** Eighteen
  operator-visible defects closed against live hardware: RF Gain that did not
  survive an ANT-menu close or a reconnect, an ATU button that could not be clicked
  back into bypass, no trustworthy ATU status, no RF Power meter and no SWR meter,
  a one-way RF Power slider, MIC Gain that was never subscribed, MON and Monitor
  Level that neither worked nor subscribed, DAX shown on a backend where it has no
  function, notches that ignored front-panel changes, VOX with no read/write path,
  and preamp/attenuator conflated with display RF Gain. CI-V encoding stays shared
  with the IC-705; model-specific behaviour — meter calibration, the MK2-only
  RX-ANT command — stays data-driven.

- **WSPR, PC Audio routing and the CW decoder (#5016).** Three defects with one
  root shape: a capability question asked the wrong way round. **WSPR** never
  transmitted from an Icom because `prepareWsprTransmit()` armed the seam-audio
  path correctly but `hasWsprTxStream()` accepted that latch only when
  `hostModulates` was true — and Icom deliberately reports it false, so PSK
  Reporter never considered the stream ready and never advanced to PTT. Readiness
  now asks whether the backend is TX-capable and explicitly takes TX audio over the
  seam, which is the question that was meant. Confirmed on the air from an
  IC-7300MK2: **20 PSK Reporter reception reports across the continental US and
  Alaska, −22 to +4 dB SNR.** **PC Audio** now switches only the model-specific
  DATA OFF modulation input — WLAN on the IC-705, LAN on the IC-7300MK2, MIC when
  disabled — and leaves DATA MOD untouched so the radio stays authoritative for
  digital-mode routing; an unknown model refuses the write rather than guessing.
  Radio Health gains DATA OFF MOD, DATA MOD and the applicable MIC/USB/ACC/WLAN/LAN
  levels. And the **built-in CW decoder** opens again on an Icom: the mode
  normalizer reports upper-sideband CW as `CWU`, while the activation gate
  recognised only `CW` and `CWL`.

- **Ask the radio for its own CI-V address (#4991).** An Icom connected with the
  CI-V field left blank was addressed at a hardcoded `0xA4` — the IC-705's address.
  CI-V is addressed, so every other model silently ignored the traffic, and because
  a wrong address produces no error the session came up looking healthy with no
  frequency, no scope and no transmit. Both the code comments and the intent were
  already there and neither was wired. Measured on an IC-9700 at 172.17.0.96 with
  the same probe built in both trees: base build `0.000000 MHz` (dead), this branch
  `445.841350 MHz` USB (alive) — and a *typed* `A4` still dead, deliberately, because
  auto-detect must not quietly rescue an address the operator chose. The Connect-by-IP
  form gains a model chooser so the answer is legible.

- **RS-BA1 lease renewal and diagnostics (#4995).** The frozen panadapter was a
  media-lease failure, not a renderer failure — serial CI-V and audio stopped
  together while the outer control socket still looked healthy. The inner renewal
  sequence was encoded as a shifted little-endian field, accidentally byte-identical
  only through sequence 255; at 256 it overwrote the next byte and the radio
  answered `0xffffffff`. Fixed as the big-endian 16-bit field the radio accepts,
  plus: token replies correlated to the current session and outstanding request, a
  fresh random request ID per login, teardown deauth through the tracked
  outer-sequence path, and a first renewal at 30 s (an immediate-reconnect grant was
  measured dying at ~45 s) before returning to the 60 s cadence. `civ session`
  reports the whole lease state, credential-free.

- **DATA mode reaches the radio — DIGU/DIGL (#4989), then DFM (#4994).** Selecting
  a data mode set the sideband but left the DATA flag clear. #4989 sends and adopts
  it; #4994 finishes the FM half, where `DFM` was missing from the codec's mode map
  entirely (so it fell through to "no equivalent" and the UI simply reverted) and a
  radio already in FM-D reported back as plain FM — so the next mode write took it
  *out* of data mode untouched by the operator, and transmit audio came from the
  microphone. On 2 m that meant an AX.25 frame keying the radio with room noise on
  the air. The IC-9700 additionally needed `hasVfoModeCommand`; `0x26` was measured
  on the live radio rather than assumed, and the table invariant that blocked it was
  corrected to ask the narrow question a measured round trip actually answers.

- **The scrub TX-safety check matched a PTT read (#4913).** `icom_backend_test`
  failed ~1 run in 2 — 14/30 on a clean build — on the Principle VI check that
  proves `controls scrub` cannot key the transmitter. It was the test: the capture
  predicate matched `1C 00`/`1C 01` on cmd+sub alone, and the zero-payload form is a
  *read* the register answers and never acts on, emitted by the 250 ms meter tick
  landing inside the observation window on timer phase. The predicate now requires a
  payload — "can move the transmitter or the ATU" — and the keying block proves the
  check has teeth before trusting it. 60/60 clean after; a mutation test injecting a
  real `cmdSetPtt(true)` is caught 6/6.

### Hermes-Lite 2

- **A host-side impulse noise blanker (#4908).** The HL2 ships raw IQ and runs no
  firmware DSP, so it correctly reports `hasRadioSideDsp = false` — and `VfoWidget`
  hid NB alongside NR and ANF. That was the right conclusion about the *command* and
  the wrong one about the *control*: the blanker can run here, and on this radio here
  is the only place it can run at all. WDSP's ANB runs on the raw IQ ahead of the
  demodulator, because an impulse is short in time and wide in frequency — once the
  8192-tap bandpass has smeared it there is no spike left to blank. Held across
  transmit, since the trigger is a ratio and an unheld blanker would gate the first
  ~7 ms of every receive period.

- **Centre the CW passband on the marker with a real BFO (#4914).** In CW the
  panadapter drew its skirt entirely to the *right* of the marker, where a USB filter
  sits. `defaultPassbandForMode` returned `{350, 850}` — a 500 Hz filter measured from
  the audio the signal becomes, not from the signal — because WDSP inserts no BFO and
  the detector is direct-conversion in every mode. On this radio that is worse than
  cosmetic: the **gateware generates the shaped CW carrier at the TX NCO**, which is
  the marker, so the receiver was listening 600 Hz from where the radio transmits. CW
  is now kept in two domains with `cwBfoHz`/`dspFilterHz`/`rxShiftHz` as the only
  translation between them.

- **Persist the operator's AGC mode and threshold (#4911).** Set Slow/40, quit,
  relaunch — the session came up Med/65, the construction default. The AGC loop for
  this radio runs in WDSP on the host, so the client is the only place the setting can
  live, and it was living nowhere: nothing captured it, nothing stored it, and nothing
  echoed it back, so the applet showed one thing while the DSP ran another. The
  threshold sentinel is `-1` rather than `0`, because zero is an AGC-T an operator can
  select.

- **Bypass the TX ALC for client-leveled TCI/DAX audio (#4910).** WSJT-X's `Pwr`
  slider is not a rig command — it is a digital attenuator on the audio the client
  streams. The host speech ALC ran over that audio, so the control was either
  normalised away or frozen into a path-dependent gain: TUNE at a low setting made no
  RF, sliding up mid-key wound the gain up, sliding back retained it. `AudioEngine`
  already marks external client audio and already bypasses the voice compressor and EQ
  for it; that bit now reaches the modulator. **The bypass is one-sided by design** —
  client audio may never be *lifted*, but it is still *reduced*: removing the reduction
  half left the hard clamp as the only thing between a hot client and the band,
  measured at twice full scale.

- **The meter surface certified on real hardware (#4916), and the five findings that
  exposed (#4917).** `radiocert meters` run against a physical HL2 (gateware v74) into
  a dummy load: `TX:MICPEAK` tracked a −20 dBFS tone to **+0.023 dB** while `TX:ALC`
  did not move at all across a 20 dB sweep — the ALC normalising, measured rather than
  assumed, and because the two meters sit on opposite sides of it and agree in opposite
  directions they certify the host transmit path between them. Every meter on the radio
  was correct; two of the concerns the tool reported were not. #4917 fixes the five
  defects that run exposed — chiefly a keyed stage producing no RF now reporting
  INCONCLUSIVE rather than advising the deletion of a working meter, and a unit check
  reading the `acceptedUnits` set instead of a single value that reported a permanent
  false positive on a healthy `TX:ALC`. Also documented: the RF power slider has 101
  positions and the gateware decodes only the drive register's top nibble, so six
  points of travel do nothing and the next single point is +1.25 dB.

### Transmit audio

- **The TX voice chain moves to 48 kHz float (#4875).** The TX channel strip was
  performing several sample-rate conversions and bit-depth truncations, compounding
  aliasing artifacts and quantization noise. The entire strip and voice pipeline is now
  pinned to 48 kHz float with a **single** high-quality conversion to transport rate,
  and unshaped TPDF dither applied immediately before the final quantization. A 12 %
  SRC profile improves latency for 44.1 and 48 kHz hosts — the two most common — while
  keeping flat response across the full 10 kHz baseband and significant alias
  rejection, at a slight latency cost below 24 kHz. Oversampling in the non-linear
  processors was deliberately left out to bound the blast radius, though 24 → 48 kHz is
  already equivalent to 2× oversampling against the previous path.

### Amplifiers & peripherals

- **VK3AMP amplifier support (#4919).** A standalone peripheral alongside
  ACOM/PGXL/TGXL: TCP control and status (ASCII CSV) plus UDP telemetry, with
  calibration curves for output, reflected, current and input power unit-tested against
  real capture values. Idle-aware keepalive and watchdog, a bypass/voltage-rail safety
  interlock, hold-to-confirm reset, and a dockable panel with Power/Reflected/SWR
  gauges. VK3AMP ships as 600 W / 1000 W / 2000 W units, so a persisted variant selector
  rescales the forward-power gauge to each unit's rated output plus 25 % headroom.
  Connection reliability came out of testing against real hardware: the amp's network
  stack answers only broadcast ARP, so a cold connect can stall 9–12 s on Windows'
  unicast-first neighbour-cache reconfirmation — hence an 18 s connect watchdog and an
  explicit socket abort before redial. The companion reverse-engineering project's
  decompile-derived fault-name table is deliberately excluded (Principle IV); v1
  surfaces the raw numeric code.

### DAX

- **8 DAX RX audio channels on a FLEX-6700 (#4854).** The DAX RX path was capped at
  4 (6600-class sizing), so slices assigned to DAX 5–8 were silently dropped — the audio
  device was created, but no radio-side `dax_rx` stream was ever requested, and the
  channel carried silence-fill. The wire path is now an upper bound of 8 (DAX **IQ**
  stays at 4) while the user-facing selectors are driven from the radio's actual slice
  capacity, so a 6300 does not present dead entries and a slice carrying a channel the
  connected radio cannot back displays as **Off** rather than a false in-range channel.
  Verified end-to-end on a 6700: eight `aethersdr-dax-N` sources carrying live audio and
  eight WSJT-X instances decoding on eight slices.

### CAT, rigctld & TCI

- **CAT band changes follow the panadapter (#4876).** A band change issued over CAT —
  WSJT-X/FLDigi "change band", rigctld `set_freq`, SmartCAT `FA`/`FB`, VFO up/down —
  moved the slice and left the panadapter behind on the old band until a manual GUI
  action. Every CAT and rigctld VFO move now routes through one recenter policy: an
  in-span target tunes without a yank (external Doppler software steps every few seconds
  and must not recenter each step), an out-of-span or cross-band target recenters and
  re-bands. Both paths go through `SliceModel` so `frequencyChanged` is emitted — the
  load-bearing signal, without which the tune did not stick on real hardware even though
  it worked on the emulator. The single seam validates the target once (finite, > 0,
  < 1 THz) and refuses a locked slice rather than reporting a false success.

- **rigctld reports split per-client (#4853).** `cmdGetSplitVfo()` and `cmdGetVfoInfo()`
  reported `split=1` whenever the radio's transmit slice differed from the slice a CAT
  port controls. With N single-VFO ports — one per WSJT-X instance — only one slice holds
  the TX flag, so every *other* port read as "in split" and WSJT-X refused emulated split
  on all but one instance. The determination is now gated on the client's own split
  state, mirroring what `cmdSetPtt()` already did. Verified on a FLEX-6700 with two
  WSJT-X instances both accepting Fake It.

- **Every TCI argument goes through a checked parse (#4870).** `TciProtocol.cpp`
  converted client-supplied arguments with unchecked `QString::toInt()` in **50 places
  across 39 handlers**. Qt returns `0` on failure, so malformed input did not fail — it
  became a valid-looking `0` and the command proceeded. This class does not fail quietly,
  it **succeeds convincingly**: the command applies, a well-formed notification goes out,
  and neither the sender nor a second client watching the wire can tell. It had been
  fixed three times one instance at a time (#4345, #4523, #4848) and survived all three.
  Thirty of the fifty sites were the trx index, which resolves positionally — so
  `mute:abc,true` muted **slice 0** and broadcast a notification naming it. All 66
  conversions now route through three helpers that leave the output untouched unless the
  argument is present and parses; `argToDouble` folds in `std::isfinite`, because Qt
  parses `"inf"`/`"nan"` and reports success. The boolean half is covered too — twenty
  sites where anything that was not the word `"true"` became `false` and was applied.

- **Remove dead TCI receive-audio code (#4844).** `TciServer::onRxAudioReady` had no
  producer anywhere in the tree, orphaned when TCI audio moved to the DAX pipeline, and
  the PC Audio toggle's comment still described keeping `remote_audio_rx` alive for a TCI
  client. Both removed. No behaviour change.

- **Gate keyerless-dependent CW tests (#4856).** Two CAT integration tests asserted a
  CW-keyer command succeeds unconditionally, but those commands need a *radio-side* keyer
  — a keyerless target, including the demo backend, correctly refuses them. The safety
  half matters: rigctld E6 ran `send_morse "TEST"` in an ungated block, which **keys CW on
  a real radio**, so a plain no-TX run transmitted on the operator's licence. Both now
  skip behind `--cw`, mirroring the suite's existing gating.

### Crash & stability

- **A multi-hour TCI transmit crash on Windows (#4958).** Two Microsoft Store dumps
  from v26.8.2 resolved against the matching PDB to the first output write in
  `TxMicChannelNormalizer::canonicalizeInt16ToMonoStereo()`, with an input block of
  `0x80007900` bytes — 30,976 past the signed 2 GiB boundary. The chain: fresh TCI audio
  suppressed the local microphone callback, so the Windows pull device was never drained;
  Qt/WASAPI kept appending at ~192 kB/s; when local mic processing resumed, `readAll()`
  returned the multi-gigabyte residue in one `QByteArray`; and the normalizer's signed
  `int` output-size arithmetic overflowed. Fixed at both ends — the mic source is drained
  while TCI owns TX audio, and every pull-mode read is bounded to a frame-aligned 256 KiB
  (~1.36 s) with oversized and partial-frame blocks rejected before allocation. Past 1 MiB
  of residue the stale head is skipped without allocation, so the freshest block reaches
  the air rather than a backlog replaying.

- **A panadapter pop-out crash no longer becomes a boot loop (#4863).** A Store crash
  report (26.7.2.0) landed in the pop-out path — a D3D11 access violation, this time in an
  **AMD** UMD where every previously confirmed case of the class died in a 2016 Intel one,
  which is independent corroboration that the extent mismatch was real rather than an
  Intel driver quirk. That crash itself was already fixed by #4329. What was not fixed is
  the blast radius: the pan ID was committed to `FloatingPanIds` *before* the reparent and
  GPU re-initialize that follow, and the restore path replayed the saved list
  unconditionally on every post-connect layout restore — so any crash inside the float path
  was self-perpetuating, with no in-app escape. #4617's reporter had to hand-edit the
  settings store to get his radio back.

- **Shutdown phase breadcrumbs (#4979).** Windows users have reported the application
  hanging on close and needing a force quit (#4273); existing logs showed that shutdown
  started but not which close or thread join was still in progress. Paired `begin`/`end`
  records with elapsed time now cover radio, audio, KiwiSDR, external controllers, spot
  clients and late worker-thread teardown, and distinguish a blocked queued invocation from
  a close routine that entered its worker and then blocked. Diagnostic instrumentation
  only — no new waits, no watchdog, no ordering change.

- **Release momentary keying when the radio disconnects (#4811).** A key held across a
  disconnect stranded its flag, because the release was discarded above the bookkeeping —
  so the first press after reconnect was silently consumed. One dead press per
  disconnect-while-held, reported as "PTT stopped working after reconnect". The existing
  `failSafeMomentaryKeyingToRx()` had three callers and none of them was radio disconnect;
  it now has a fourth. Since #4611 the same class reached the CW flags through the Ulanzi
  dial paths, so the central release covers the whole family.

### GUI & workflow

- **Clone to all Pans (#4881).** Tune the look on one panadapter, press the button in the
  Display panel's SYSTEM group, and every other open pan matches — previously a second pan
  meant re-picking every colour, fill rate, scheme, floor and 3D setting by hand. Three
  kinds of setting live in that panel and each travels its own way: client appearance whose
  setter already persists per-pan, client appearance whose setter does not (background image
  and opacity, whose writes MainWindow has always owned), and radio-authoritative values —
  FFT average, FPS, weighted average, waterfall rate, colour gain, black level — which are
  never persisted client-side and so are cloned by sending the same commands the sliders
  send and letting the radio echo back. Auto-black clones the operator's stored **intent**,
  not the capability-masked value, so cloning cannot quietly downgrade every other pan.

- **The mini-pan centres on the passband, not the carrier (#4874).** On SSB the carrier
  sits at the *edge* of the receive filter, so a carrier-centred ±5 kHz window spent half
  its width on the sideband the filter throws away. One shared helper parameterises both the
  frame cut and the chrome — two copies of that arithmetic would let the trace and the wash
  end up centred on different frequencies, which is the one thing a tuning aid must never do.
  Symmetric filters give an offset of zero and render exactly as before. The hairline still
  marks the carrier, because that is the frequency the readout above it shows.

- **PSK Reporter map: navigation stalls and world wrap (#4952).** Dragging and trackpad
  scrolling churned tiles, re-decoded cached PNGs and hit-tested markers on every drag
  frame; horizontal navigation stopped dead at the antimeridian, forcing a pan all the way
  around to compare Asia against North America. The camera and tile layer now repeat
  continuously across the dateline, with wrapped requests coalesced onto canonical OSM URLs
  so the repetition costs no extra GETs, markers and propagation paths replicated into every
  visible world copy, a bounded 64 MiB decoded-image cache above the existing disk cache,
  and marker hit-testing skipped while dragging. Wheel and high-resolution trackpad deltas
  are normalized onto one symmetric zoom curve — equal notches in and out now return exactly
  to the starting scale, where upstream lost ~11 % per round trip.

- **SpotHub auto-scroll follows the correct end (#4922).** The spot model prepends, so the
  newest spot is always row 0 — but the auto-scroll followed the *bottom*, a lambda copied
  from the append-only console panes. It was self-latching: on an empty table
  `value == maximum == 0`, so follow started true and `scrollToBottom()` kept it true
  forever, pinning the viewport to the oldest end while the thumb walked down. Only Time
  descending was visibly broken, because Time ascending happens to put the newest at the
  bottom where the old logic was accidentally right. The follow end is now derived from the
  current sort, and a sort by any other column does not auto-scroll at all rather than
  disturbing where the operator put the viewport.

- **The Copy Assist indicator gates on the active slice (#4932).** The status-bar **ASR**
  indicator was greyed out whenever no slice was flagged as the transmit slice — so an
  operator who disables TX for safety, or runs receive-only, could not open Copy Assist at
  all. It is a receive-side feature; nothing about it depends on the TX slice. CWX and DVK
  are transmit keyers and keep following it. Two consequences stated plainly: the indicator
  row can now disagree with itself by design, and the auto-hide can stop a running
  transcription when a CW slice is selected.

- **Restore automatic QRhi colour-buffer sizing (#4359).** AetherSDR's global fixed,
  ceil'd, even-aligned colour buffer could differ from the widget's natural device-pixel
  extent at fractional scale factors, and `QRhiWidget` then scales the buffer to the
  widget — whole-surface resampling that produced a faint stationary horizontal line even
  after #4322 made the waterfall image and its destination rectangle 1:1. The override was
  one of three bundled mitigations for an old Intel D3D11 crash and was never independently
  demonstrated to be necessary; the other two were structural and remain.

- **Frameless move and edge resize under xcb (#4829).** Drag-to-move on the menu bar and
  left/right/bottom edge resize did nothing under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` — only the
  QSizeGrip corner worked. Two independent causes: `startSystemMove()`/`startSystemResize()`
  report success on xcb but the WM-driven grab is unreliable there (QTBUG-69716), which Qt's
  own QSizeGrip works around by refusing the platform path; and the edge-resize filter never
  received any events on MainWindow at all, because a QWindow does *not* receive every
  platform mouse event once a child acquires a native window — the status bar, central widget
  and size grip are all native and between them cover the whole client area. The filter now
  installs application-wide and matches by walking each event window's parent chain.
  Reported and manually verified by @JonathanPerkins.

- **The last un-scoped stylesheet in the overlay menu (#4866).** #4847 scoped all five
  overlay panels and its description closed with "no un-scoped `QWidget { … }` selector
  left" — one site short. An un-scoped sheet survived *inside* the Ant panel on the
  preamp/attenuator container rows, cancelling a cascade the same way the bug worked: by
  broadcasting a bare type selector at every descendant, tooltip labels included. A second
  helper alongside `applyPanelStyle()` covers bare containers, and every stylesheet on a
  container widget in that file now goes through one of the two — so there is no site left
  where an object name and its selector are written in two places and can drift apart.

### Copy Assist

- **Context-carry via explicit prompt (#4831).** RFC #4818, opt-in and off by default.
  Each decode can be conditioned on the text the backend produced on its last confident
  segment, for continuity across utterance boundaries — names, callsigns, topic. Carried
  through whisper's explicit `initial_prompt` rather than its internal cross-call prompt,
  which whisper rebuilds unconditionally so the confidence gate could never reach it; that
  was the "kept re-seeding and couldn't recover" behaviour on noisy audio. Recovery paths:
  a 0.65 confidence gate, a 2.5 s silence-gap flush, and Clear — which turns out to have
  been wired to nothing at all, wiping only the text box.

### Controllers & MIDI

- **Import and export MIDI binding profiles (#4898).** Import ingests a profile file and
  auto-detects the dialect by content: the native `<MidiProfile>` XML, or the SmartSDR
  iOS/Mac `.map` that controller vendors publish per device. Export writes the current
  bindings as the same document Import reads back. The policy is import what maps, name what
  doesn't, never silently drop — the result carries imported counts, named skips with their
  reasons, named duplicates and file-level errors, and an existing profile name gets a
  " (2)" suffix rather than being overwritten. Load also now reports an empty or missing
  profile instead of silently doing nothing.

### Automation bridge

- **Connection-path resolution and TX drive readout (#4918).** Five gaps, all the same
  shape — the bridge knew something and didn't say it. `connect ip <addr>` with no family
  probed the connect dialog's selector, which on a fresh instance means Flex, costing ~25
  minutes of a hardware session while the reply said `ok:true` throughout; `connect list`
  never serialised `family`, so you could not read it back or work around the first gap;
  `connect wait` could not distinguish a dead connect from one still queued behind the HL2's
  DSP open; every connect verb replied before its real work ran, with failures reaching only
  a warning log; and there was no applied-drive readout anywhere, so the readback shared the
  failure it was meant to catch in the one area that is safety-adjacent.

### CI, build & governance

- **Restore compiler caches everywhere, save only on main (#5008).** The repository shares
  one 10 GB Actions cache budget, and every run — PR runs included — wrote a fresh ~0.6 GB
  entry. Actions caches are scoped by ref: a PR's entry lands on `refs/pull/N/merge`, which
  no other PR may read. So every PR run wrote something nothing else could ever use, and its
  only effect was evicting the shared `main` entry all 26 open PRs *can* read. Measured
  2026-08-16: 8.62 GB across 14 PR-scoped entries against 2.00 GB on `main` — 80 % of the
  budget unreadable, with no Linux ccache or Windows sccache entry left on `main` at all.
  PR #5002 took 19+ minutes against a 7–13 minute norm. All three build jobs now restore on
  every run and save only from a green `main` build.

- **The colour ratchet takes its base from the merge base (#4960).** The gate compared two
  trees not required to share a `main`: `github.sha` freezes when a run is created, while
  `origin/<base_ref>` resolves when the job runs, so when main *loses* colours in between the
  drop is billed to whichever PR happens to be running. #4895 — a five-line comment edit the
  scanner cannot even see — failed with "+5", which turned out to be #4866's cleanup,
  sign-flipped, reported against it. The two sides were 22 h 26 m apart, a gap fork PRs are
  guaranteed by their workflow-approval hold.

- **Trim three steps off the per-PR gate (#4873).** The HL2 AM/SAM DC blocker test measured
  **188–190 s, dead flat**, across four consecutive main runs — second most expensive step in
  the job behind the build itself, and more than every other gate step combined by two orders
  of magnitude, against a comment claiming it "runs in well under a second". It is not a
  flake; it is what the test does, and it still runs weekly. Stated plainly: the vendored
  liquid-dsp build check was the only thing in CI compiling that snapshot, and nothing
  backstops it now.

- **Split test registration into `tests/tests.cmake` (#5002).** The root `CMakeLists.txt`
  was 6,357 lines, over half of it test registration; it is now 2,780. A pure move — the
  3,239 relocated lines are byte-identical, `ctest -N` lists the same 304 tests and the
  target list is unchanged. `include()` rather than `add_subdirectory()` is load-bearing:
  include executes in the caller's directory scope, so ~800 relative source paths and nine
  `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}` references move across untouched — the latter would have
  failed *quietly*, handing a still-passing test an env var pointing one directory too deep.
  Four guards make reaching for the old location fail.

- **CODEOWNERS: Tier 1 narrowed (#4959), `docs/`, `resources/` and `tests/` to Tier 3
  (#5001).** Tier 1 had accreted paths that are documentation rather than governance — 21
  maintainer-gated paths absorbed 467 commits in twelve months, and the AI-instruction files
  alone were 37 % of that traffic. Tier 1 is now a single test: *does a wrong change here
  alter who decides things, or what gets signed?* `CONTRIBUTING.md` was split rather than
  moved, with its operational bulk becoming `docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` and
  `docs/PR-WORKFLOW.md`. #5001 then fixed the `*.md` depth trap — a glob with no slash matches
  markdown at any depth, so every guide under `docs/` and every help topic under
  `resources/help/` sat on the infrastructure roster while the directory around it did not —
  and moved `tests/` (~90k lines of C++ across 305 TUs) to the roster that reviews the code it
  tests. Nobody loses authority: the infrastructure roster is a strict subset of the reviewer
  roster.

### Documentation

- **A theme style guide for agents (#4850).** `docs/style/theme-style-guide.md` — the map
  from system states to ThemeManager tokens, published as the missing documentation behind the
  colour drift measured in #4569, where unique colours rose by 105 while references fell ~22 %.
  The reading is that this is a knowledge-distribution failure rather than an enforcement one:
  the 99 shipped `color.*` tokens already name every state the drifting literals approximate,
  but at the moment an agent picks a colour nothing told it the map existed. Covers the
  semantic map, the consumption API, the no-new-literals rule and its boundaries, the
  add-a-token path, and the colour-as-data exemptions.

- **Correct the TCI audio guidance (#4895).** The comment telling WSJT-X users to enable PC
  Audio was stale: the receive path uses DAX channels acquired by
  `TciServer::ensureDaxForTci()`, and host-modulating backends relay per-slice TCI audio
  through the backend seam. Neither consults `PcAudioEnabled`, which gates only the separate
  `remote_audio_rx` stream.

- **README and ROADMAP** now name the networked-Icom models accurately, correcting an
  IC-9700/IC-7300 mix-up that shipped in the v26.8.2 documentation.

## [v26.8.2] — 2026-08-09

### A third radio family: networked Icom · HL2 gets notches and frequency calibration · SPE Expert amplifiers · three new spot overlays · CW timing to spec

57 commits since v26.8.1. The headline is a **new radio family**: `IcomCIV`, an
`IRadioBackend` implementor for networked Icoms, brought up against a live
**IC-705** and then against an **IC-9700**. CI-V is Icom's documented command
plane; it travels inside **RS-BA1**, a three-stream UDP transport Icom documents
nowhere, implemented behaviourally with kappanhang (MIT) attributed and wfview
read as specification only. FT8 both decodes and spots on PSK Reporter over two
wireless hops. The seam now carries **four** backends.

Bringing a third vendor up flushed out a set of defects that were invisible from
a Flex and affected *every* non-Flex backend: a meter seam that ignored the unit
it carried, receive-DSP controls that emitted FlexRadio wire text and nothing
else, a capability that conflated "the host modulates" with "transmit audio
leaves through the seam" — and **a null-pointer crash on connect that was live
on `main` and took down HL2 and KiwiSDR too**.

The **Hermes-Lite 2** closed two more gaps against a Flex. **Manual notch
filters** are placeable from the panadapter, driving a WDSP notch database that
was vendored but never declared — 33.4 dB measured off-air on WWV. **Frequency
calibration** gives a radio with a free-running crystal and no calibration
register a single per-radio ppb correction that covers every band and both
oscillators. And the **first connect no longer freezes the application** for
21–82 seconds: the FFTW planning that caused it was already off the GUI thread,
the GUI thread was simply waiting for it — and the result was then thrown away
on every exit, so a genuinely one-time cost was being paid on every launch.

Rounding it out: **SPE Expert amplifiers** (1.3K-FA / 1.5K-FA / 2K-FA) join
ACOM as a supported peripheral; **three new spot and schedule overlays** land in
SpotHub — N1MM+/DXLog contest bandmap, the EiBi shortwave broadcast schedule,
and the KiwiSDR DX Community database; **US 60m follows the FCC Report & Order**
that took effect in February; the local **iambic keyer now keys to spec**
(30 WPM measured at 29.998 on macOS, against 26.26 before); and **MNR gains
20 dB of stationary-noise attenuation** it was never delivering.

### Icom — a new radio family

- **`IcomCIV` backend for networked Icom radios (#4784).** Connect and
  authenticate in ~250 ms, panadapter at 30 sweeps/s, RX audio, TCI RX, and
  receive handedness certified against WWV (USB/DIGU within 0.5 dB, LSB/DIGL
  within 0.6 dB). An Icom remembers its own frequency, mode and filter across
  power cycles, so this backend never pushes restored state and instead *reads*
  the radio's own levels at connect. Only the IC-705 and IC-7300MK2 are marked
  `verified` against their own CI-V guides; an unknown radio falls back to no
  scope and no transmit rather than optimistic defaults.

- **IC-705 bring-up — controls, UX and the CI-V stall (#4799).** RF Gain,
  preamp and attenuator now say what they mean (the gain slider had been driving
  the preamp); manual notch is wired to the radio's own `MN` rather than the
  Flex-only DSP buttons an Icom cannot do; filter buttons follow the mode and
  read narrow→wide instead of publishing one ladder for every mode; AF gain, TX
  monitor, VOX, RIT/XIT and the ATU are wired and adopted from the radio at
  connect. The connect dialog stops flipping the radio type as you type an IP,
  and the password is staged and saved **after** a successful connect — it used
  to be written before the attempt, so a failed connect destroyed the stored
  one. The **60–90 second CI-V stall** was a session token renewed by a single
  fire-and-forget datagram against a 60 s expiry: one lost packet silently
  expired the session while the transport stayed healthy. Now a 20 s cadence
  with a 2.5 s ack grace, up to four retries and a 50 s dead-session failure,
  proven stable across four renewal windows.

- **IC-9700 support (#4786).** Four faults, one of them not Icom-specific:

  - **A null `PanadapterStream` crashed the GUI thread on connect** — live on
    `main`, and reachable on **HL2 and KiwiSDR** as well as Icom. `m_panStream`
    is assigned only on the Flex and Sim paths, so any backend that decodes its
    own scope was killed by the first dBm range it reported. No user action
    required; it fired by itself on connect.
  - **The dBm auto-floor ran away** at a linear 24 dB/s because it waited for an
    echo a radio with no display-range command plane can never send. New
    `radioOwnsDbmScale` capability, defaulting `true` so every existing backend
    is untouched.
  - **Configuration advice was emitted on a fatal channel**, so a healthy
    session tore itself down 4 ms after coming up and reconnected every 5 s
    forever. New `IRadioBackend::configurationWarning` for advice that does not
    end the session.
  - **The MOD Input warning was wrong on every non-705 networked Icom** — it
    demanded `MOD Input = WLAN`, and the IC-9700 is LAN-only. Now gated on the
    model's `hasWifi` flag.

  Also: CI-V open now retries (one open was not reliably enough — the radio
  accepted it and sent nothing), and the connection panel gained a CI-V address
  field.

- **AetherModem transmits on a seam backend (#4812).** The built-in AX.25 modem
  could not transmit at all on a backend declaring `takesTxAudioOverSeam` — it
  gated on `hostModulates`, took the DAX branch, and waited on a stream a
  networked Icom has never had. Nothing logged an error, because every layer was
  correct by its own lights. Verified on an IC-9700: PTT keys, the T1 retry
  ladder runs, and TX meters go live.

- **Shared defects the bring-up exposed (#4784).** `MeterModel` ignored the unit
  it was given — `TX:FWDPWR` was unconditionally converted from dBm, so an
  honest 5 watts arrived as 0.003 W. `SliceModel::setNr/setNb/setAnf/setSquelch`
  emitted Flex wire text with no `IRadioBackend` verb behind them, so no other
  backend could implement them however much it wanted to. And `hostModulates`
  was answering two questions where there are three cases — split out as
  `takesTxAudioOverSeam`.

### Hermes-Lite 2

- **Manual notch filters on the panadapter (#4780).** Right-click a signal to
  add or remove a notch, drag to move, drag vertically to resize. WDSP's
  vendored snapshot already carried a 1024-entry notch database behind its
  notched-bandpass stage and none of it was declared in the port shim, so
  nothing above could reach it. `IRadioBackend` gains typed `createNotch` /
  `setNotch` / `removeNotch` / `setNotchesEnabled` verbs; Flex rebuilds the
  identical command strings and is unchanged. RX filter taps go 2048 → 8192,
  because filter length also sets the *narrowest possible notch* — 2048 floors a
  notch at 200 Hz, wide enough to swallow a CW signal beside the carrier being
  notched. **That costs a constant +64.0 ms of RX audio latency on every HL2
  receiver, whether or not a notch is ever placed**, and the trade is stated
  rather than implied. Measured off-air against WWV on 10 MHz: 33.4 dB on the
  carrier, tracking held across two 8 kHz NCO moves, and the mirror frequency
  left alone within 1.8 dB.

- **Manual frequency calibration (#4783).** A **Calibration** page in Radio
  Setup, a `freqcal` bridge verb, and one per-radio ppb correction applied to
  every frequency the app sends. The HL2 tunes off a free-running 38.4 MHz
  crystal and the NCO scale is a `localparam` in the bitstream — no register in
  the HPSDR map accepts a correction, so the host applies one or nobody does.
  Displayed frequency works out to `F/(1+e)` independent of where the NCO sits,
  so one multiplicative scalar corrects every band. Transmit is corrected
  identically, because the gateware derives both oscillators from one
  `freqcomp`. Stored as a MAC-keyed feature document, so an operator with two
  HL2s does not get one's calibration silently applied to the other.

- **The first connect no longer freezes the app (#4775).** Connecting an HL2 for
  the first time froze everything for **21–82 seconds** with nothing on screen
  to explain it — reported as "the client has completely hung". It was FFTW
  measuring plans for WDSP's `FFTW_PATIENT` channel setup: correctly off the GUI
  thread, with the GUI thread standing there waiting for all of it through
  `Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection`. `connectRadio()` now splits into three phases
  and the UI stays live throughout (219 of 219 automation pings answered, longest
  gap 0.50 s, against 0 of ~200 before). Separately, **the wisdom was never
  saved**: export was an `std::atexit` handler, which SIGTERM, a crash and a
  Force Quit all skip — so anyone who had ever force-quit was paying first-run
  cost on every run. Export moved to the end of `open()`, write-then-rename, so
  a concurrent export cannot truncate the shared cache. Next launch: 0.57 s.

- **AM/SAM demodulated audio is DC-blocked (#4774).** The WAVE applet drew two
  waveforms, the lower one upside down, on AM and SAM. WDSP's AM/SAM detector is
  an *envelope* detector emitting `sqrt(I²+Q²)`, so the carrier lands in the
  audio as a DC pedestal — `levelfade` deliberately holds it there, the
  symmetric AM passband cannot strip it, and AetherSDR had no RX DC blocker at
  all. Not cosmetic: measured on a 50%-modulated carrier, the pedestal alone sat
  **79% past full scale** after AGC, so AM audio was clipping against the rails
  everywhere downstream. A 20 Hz one-pole blocker now runs unconditionally in
  every mode (a no-op on the already-zero-mean ones).

- **CWX, DVK and FDX are hidden on radios that cannot do them (#4777).** Three
  Flex-shaped status-bar toggles were nothing but a command-plane verb, so on a
  backend with no command plane they sat permanently dim — which reads as a
  fault to go looking for rather than a fact about the radio. Gated by
  visibility, not enabled state, on three explicit capabilities. The F1–F12
  keyer shortcuts needed the gate too: an HL2 in CW kept firing `cwx send` into
  a backend with no such verb.

### Amplifiers & peripherals

- **SPE Expert amplifiers — 1.3K-FA / 1.5K-FA / 2K-FA (#4531).** A second
  peripheral amplifier following the ACOM precedent, entirely outside the radio
  seam. Serial (115200 8N1) or ser2net TCP, raw **or** telnet, both verified on
  real hardware; a 100 ms status poll because the SPE only speaks when spoken
  to; poll-silence detection, so a ser2net TCP link that outlives the amp being
  switched off is reported as such; model identification from the status ID
  field; and an RFC 2217 DTR/RTS **power-ON pulse** that works over the network.
  A dedicated applet carries power / antenna-SWR / ATU-SWR gauges (the power
  gauge rescales with the selected LOW/MID/HIGH level, matching the amp's own
  display), V/I/temperature readouts, a warning and alarm banner, and the
  front-panel keystrokes. Implemented from SPE's published *Application
  Programmer's Guide* Rev 1.1.

### Spots, schedules & band data

- **N1MM+ / DXLog contest bandmap spots (#4678).** A SmartSDR-CAT-compatible
  N1MMSpot UDP XML listener puts contest bandmap spots — including
  dupe / needed-multiplier / CQ / busy / bust status — directly on the
  panadapter. Default port 12060, matching the `FocusHelperN1MMPort` SmartSDR
  documents, so existing broadcast configs work unchanged. Unlike every other
  feed, N1MM explicitly says when to add, update and remove, so spots are keyed
  by callsign+band rather than deduped by frequency, with a configurable-lifetime
  safety net for a logger that exits without sending deletes. Eight configurable
  status→colour swatches.

- **EiBi shortwave broadcast schedule overlay (#4822).** Downloads, caches and
  parses the EiBi schedule into a dedicated SpotHub tab: auto-start, a live spot
  counter, forced re-download, cache and next-fetch timestamps, conditional
  `If-Modified-Since` updates on a 7-day threshold, and a customisable spot
  colour that repaints active markers live. Resolves 289 country codes, 560
  language/mode codes, target-area codes and 1,629 transmitter sites into
  rich-text tooltips.

- **KiwiSDR DX Community spots overlay (#4828).** KiwiSDR's community-curated DX
  database bundled as an independent, **opt-in** overlay layer for shortwave
  utility, beacon, broadcast and DX spots. Cyan diamond markers on the band-plan
  strip, hover tooltips with frequency, station, mode, passband cuts and notes,
  and click-to-tune that sets frequency, RX filter bandwidth and — when SpotHub's
  **Auto** button is on — the operating mode, through a normalising whitelist so
  an unrecognised mode string can never reach the radio as a command.

- **US 60m follows the FCC Report & Order effective 13 Feb 2026 (#4762).** The
  ARRL plan still carried the pre-2026 five-channel allocation, so it drew a
  100 W channel over spectrum capped at 9.15 W ERP and omitted 15 kHz US
  operators have had since February. The new **5351.5 – 5366.5 kHz** segment is
  added with its own colour so the power boundary reads off the panadapter, the
  retired 5358.5 kHz channel is removed, the four retained channels keep their
  historic numbering (1, 2, 4, 5) so markers still agree with existing logs, and
  emission labels go `USB` → `CW/USB/DATA`. Separately, the 60m band edges in
  `BandDefs.h` clipped the top 1.3 kHz of the 5405 kHz channel — every
  frequency→band lookup reported "not 60m" in that sliver, so band-stack entries
  saved under "Other", the per-band auto-save cap skipped them, and digital-mode
  band matching failed. Reported by @csylvain (KB3CS), who caught that the
  automated triage was arguing from superseded law.

- **The SpotHub Time column sorts (#4751).** Clicking it did nothing — only the
  Freq column returned a sort value — so once you had sorted by frequency there
  was no way back to time order.

- **A status-message field in the FreeDV Reporter panel (#4757).** The panel was
  read-only, so changing your status message meant a trip to SpotHub → FreeDV.
  Both surfaces read and write the same setting and stay in sync. The row
  disables itself and says why when reporting is off, with the explanation on an
  always-enabled container — Qt does not deliver tooltips to disabled widgets,
  so putting it on the field would have hidden it in exactly the state that
  needs explaining.

- **KiwiSDR receiver lists import and export as CSV (#4753).** Moves a saved
  receiver list between machines and operating systems without hand-copying
  entries. **Passwords are never exported** — they live in the OS keychain,
  keyed by profile id. Import merges on a normalised-endpoint match, so
  re-importing the same file is idempotent and keeps existing ids and passwords.

### Spectrum, waterfall & 3D FFT

- **K4-style mini-pan (#4562).** A small, detachable window showing a narrow
  ±5/±10 kHz slice of spectrum centred on the active VFO, independent of the
  main panadapter and usable when it is hidden (Minimal Mode) or alongside
  third-party contest logging. It is an independent top-level window, so it
  floats over other applications and survives AetherSDR being minimised. Live on
  a FLEX-6500 at ~26 Hz/bin, five times finer than the 200 kHz main pan. The pan
  is owned but never becomes the active pan and never takes a slice slot.

- **The 3D stacked-trace wedges close (#4779).** Every row covered the same
  frequency span while the far rows narrowed with perspective, leaving two empty
  black triangles flanking the surface. Rows now *cover* a wider span rather
  than being *placed* differently, so the near rows run off both edges and the
  existing depth narrowing walks them back in. The projection is deliberately
  untouched — the converging slant of a signal through depth, the frequency
  ruler and every marker stay exactly where they were. A new **3D Span** slider
  under Display → 3D VIEW; **0 restores today's rendering exactly**.

- **3D FFT works on the Raspberry Pi 5 (#4754).** `dss_mesh` is the only shader
  using the `flat` qualifier, which is legal only in GLSL 130 and later — and
  `qsb`'s default target set bakes a 120 slice. The Pi's v3d driver reports GLSL
  1.40, no 140 slice existed, QRhi fell back to 120, and the shader failed to
  compile, silently disabling the 3D FFT on every RPi5. Desktop GPUs reporting
  GL 3.2+ picked the 150 slice and were unaffected, which is why CI never saw
  it. `dss_mesh` now bakes 130/140/150/300es; no shader source changed.

- **3D FFT history outlines render on Linux/OpenGL (#4730).** The dedicated
  OpenGL outline pipeline rasterised its geometry but observed flat or stale
  mesh-height data, so the leading edge was static or absent and the pan preview
  did not update. Metal, D3D11 and other backends keep the dedicated pipeline
  unchanged.

- **Windows panadapters are no longer blank under software OpenGL (#4748).**
  With `AETHER_NO_GPU` or `QT_OPENGL=software` set, the panadapter selected
  OpenGL while the hidden WAVE scope had already selected D3D11 for the same
  top-level window. Qt rejects mixed QRhi APIs in one backing store, producing
  13,804 `QRhiWidget: No QRhi` messages and leaving every panadapter
  transparent. Every `QRhiWidget` in the main window now honours the same
  software-OpenGL request; the default D3D11 path is unchanged.

- **A headless Wayland session automatically prefers xcb (#4755).** With no
  physical monitor — the typical VNC/wayvnc remote case — there is no DRM
  scanout, so the driver cannot allocate a GL window surface and every frame's
  `makeCurrent` fails with `EGL_BAD_MATCH`. The panadapter renders black, and
  `AETHER_NO_GPU=1` does not help, because the failure is the wayland-egl
  *surface*, not the renderer. Detection is a tri-state — xcb is forced only
  when at least one connector reports `disconnected` and none reports
  `connected`; an all-`unknown` set keeps the native-Wayland default, because
  DPI, composite TV-out and some fixed DSI panels report `unknown` with a panel
  physically attached. The decision is logged at startup so it is diagnosable
  from a support bundle, and a user-set `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` still wins.

- **Waterfall interpolation is clamped at history boundaries (#4794).** Both GPU
  waterfall shaders derived their four cubic taps in wrapped physical texture
  coordinates, so a tap just past the newest or oldest logical row could alias
  the opposite end of the circular texture and blend an unrelated row — an
  occasional bright, dark or scrambled horizontal line during rapid pan or zoom.
  Taps are now computed as logical source ages, clamped, and only then mapped
  through the circular write-row origin.

- **Waterfall Blanker rows stay in one frequency frame (#4802).** The blanker
  cached only the viewport pixels of the last accepted row, so a rejection
  during pan or zoom combined historical pixels with the rejected tile's
  supplemental pixels and labelled the result with the current viewport frame —
  permanently retaining a shifted or internally inconsistent row. A replacement
  is now one coherent transaction, and substituted rows are kept out of temporal
  interpolation.

- **QRhi spectrum failures are visible (#4787).** `QRhiWidget::renderFailed()`
  fired with nothing listening, so a GPU that failed mid-session left a blank
  panadapter and no explanation. Each GPU `SpectrumWidget` now surfaces a
  persistent warning card over the affected pan, updates renderer diagnostics,
  and exposes the state through `get rhi`.

- **Off-screen slice indicators centre on a single click (#4795).** The active
  indicator emitted nothing, so the one slice you were most likely to be chasing
  ignored single clicks; inactive ones followed generic reveal behaviour instead
  of centring. Centring now goes through MainWindow's canonical path, preserving
  Center Lock, profile-load deferral, Kiwi/widget-local centring and cross-pan
  ownership.

- **The remaining `SpectrumOverlayMenu` panel stylesheets are scoped (#4847).**
  An un-scoped `QWidget { background; border }` rule cascades into Qt's tooltip
  `QLabel` and every other bare container in the panel, because a Qt type
  selector matches subclasses and propagates to descendants. Following #4440,
  every panel sheet in the file is now scoped to its own object name through one
  helper, which also drops two hardcoded `#304050` literals in favour of a theme
  token — so the light theme themes those borders correctly instead of pinning
  the dark value. Removing the cascade also removes accidental frames it was
  drawing on bare containers in the Ant panel.

### Receive DSP & audio

- **MNR delivers the attenuation it advertised (#4807).** Its minimum-statistics
  estimator took a raw minimum across 25 periodograms, systematically
  underestimating stationary noise power and leaving the Wiener gain near unity;
  the decision-directed recurrence mixed raw FFT power into a dimensionless SNR
  term; and the strength-blended output gain fed back into the adaptive state.
  Maximum-strength stationary attenuation was **4.54 dB**. It is now
  **24.4 dB**, scale-invariant within 1 dB, with +18.8 dB SNR improvement on
  speech-like input for −2.8 dB of desired-signal level. The redundant
  `Enable MNR` checkbox and its dead settings wiring are removed — the method
  selector is the sole enable, consistent with the other AetherDSP methods.

- **DFNR no longer pumps on stereo (#4788).** It routed its mono denoised
  waveform through `MonoDspStereoAdapter`, which switched to delayed dry stereo
  whenever the input channels were not effectively identical, then drove that
  dry signal with a fast processed-to-dry power envelope — the same
  speech-dependent pumping family already fixed in RN2. The processed mono
  waveform is now authoritative and the dry stereo is used only to estimate a
  slow left/right balance.

- **The AetherVoice EQ canvas caches its layers (#4808).** It rebuilt the
  full-width band response plus static grid, labels and band-plan decoration on
  every analyzer frame, on the GUI thread, scaling with strip width. Split into
  DPR-aware cached background and response layers with only the live FFT trace
  dynamic: measured on the same Windows VM, 73.1% → 37.4% of one core at
  1280×900 and 82.8% → 43.1% at 2200×1300.

- **Audio mute commands reach the model (#4772).** `RadioModel`'s three
  audio-mute setters sent their command and returned — never assigning, never
  emitting — while their immediate neighbours `setLineoutGain()` /
  `setHeadphoneGain()` did both. `FlexBackend` is the only parser of those mute
  statuses, so on every other backend the flags sat at their `false` initialisers
  for the life of the session: mute the headphones, nudge the volume, and the
  glyph silently flipped back to unmuted from the stale flag under a signal
  blocker. The three mutes are now also cleared on disconnect.

- **The title bar headphone mute reconciles with the radio (#4733).** It sent a
  hand-written mixer command and never updated from radio status, so a second
  Multi-Flex client changing headphone mute left the icon lying.

- **The header speaker emoji follows local PC audio mute (#4628).** It now
  tracks `AudioEngine`'s mute state, while clicking the same button still
  commands the radio's line out.

### CW

- **Mode B no longer drops the trailing element on a clean simultaneous release
  (#4810).** The memory latch ran only at condition-variable wakes, and a wake
  caused by a release always observes post-release state — so when both paddles
  came up in one combined update the "opposite paddle was held" fact was
  overwritten before it could be observed and the keyer behaved like Mode A.
  Routine on the serial path, where a 10 ms poll collapses both edges into one
  event. The opposite paddle is now snapshotted at element start, in addition to
  the existing live checks. Reported by @rsaue with a root-cause analysis that
  verified accurate in full.

- **Iambic sidetone timing — absolute-grid scheduling and sample-accurate edges
  (#4823).** Two independent halves, both measured from @williamscody's own
  attachments. `workerLoop()` armed each deadline as `now() + duration`, read
  *after* the previous wait returned and after the key-edge callback ran, so
  every element ran long by a fresh strictly-positive error that never
  self-corrected — a one-sided +4 ms mean, ~10% slow at 30 WPM on the reporter's
  M2. Deadlines now advance on an absolute `steady_clock` grid anchored at
  squeeze start, the same pattern `CwxLocalKeyer` got in #3644, tracked in
  nanoseconds so 23 WPM no longer runs permanently fast of spec.
  `CwSidetoneGenerator` read its key gate once per audio block and applied it to
  the whole buffer, quantising every precisely-timed edge to a block boundary;
  transitions are now timestamped into a lock-free ring and mapped to exact
  sample offsets, splitting the block mid-buffer. **Measured on real hardware
  (Intel MBP, HaliKey Serial): 45.70 ms/unit → 40.002 ms/unit at a 30 WPM
  setting, i.e. 26.26 WPM → 29.998 WPM.**

### Copy Assist (speech-to-text)

- **A GPU that cannot be used falls back to CPU instead of taking the app down
  (#4767).** On a machine whose Vulkan stack enumerates GPUs but cannot create a
  logical device, Copy Assist crashed the process silently — with no dialog and
  nothing in the app log. **It is the second GPU attempt that kills it, not the
  first**: whisper catches the first throw internally, but ggml-vulkan's
  instance state is sticky, so a later init short-circuits against a
  half-initialised instance and faults through a null dispatch pointer. Nothing
  in `try`/`catch` can intercept that, so the fix is to never make the second
  attempt: guards on the three ggml entry points, a one-shot CPU retry, and a
  one-way per-session failure latch so a failed device is never handed another
  attempt however it is chosen. The selector now labels unusable devices,
  resolves to the first usable one (else CPU), does not persist a computed
  resolution over the saved preference, and says in plain language when a
  fallback has happened — previously the dialog went on naming a GPU that was
  running nothing while the queue grew from 7.6 s to 22.5 s with no explanation.

- **Enabling speaker labels no longer freezes the GUI (#4739).** The speaker
  toggle, model-ready and custom-model paths rebuilt `AsrEngine` on the GUI
  thread, and destroying the old engine performs an unbounded worker-thread
  join — so ONNX work already in flight blocked Qt event processing and could
  starve radio servicing. Preparation stays on the ASR worker thread, rapid
  off/on requests are deduplicated, and only the audio tap is paused while
  loading.

- **Segment overlap for boundary-word recovery (#4837, RFC #4821).** When an
  utterance is force-closed by the max-length cap — speech still ongoing, not a
  real pause — the cut can fall mid-word, and because each segment is decoded
  independently the straddling word is mangled or dropped. A small window of
  trailing audio is now carried into the next segment and the repeated boundary
  words de-duplicated at the text level, which adds zero inference cost, needs
  no whisper-param change, and works uniformly across the whisper, sherpa-onnx
  and remote backends. **Opt-in, off by default** — a "Boundary overlap" slider
  at 0 ms.

- **`AsrTapPolicy::toMono()` takes an explicit channel count (#4846).** It
  decided stereo-vs-mono by testing whether the float count was even, standing
  in for a channel count the caller actually knows: a genuinely mono block with
  an even float count was averaged pairwise, handing the engine half as many
  samples at the wrong duration. Latent today, live the moment any RX source
  emits mono on that signal. A block that is not a whole number of frames for
  the stated channel count is now rejected rather than reinterpreted.

### Controllers & MIDI

- **Rotary action mapping for the Ulanzi Dial (#4702).** A *Tuning:* rotary
  action selector covering frequency, filter bandwidth, slice and master volume,
  panadapter zoom, RIT/XIT, AGC-T, RF gain, APF, CW speed and RF power, with the
  dial-press combo relabelled *Single tap:*. Follow-ups scale filter-preset
  stepping by the magnitude of the rotary step rather than discarding it, and
  document why the rotary zoom factor (1.25) differs from the keyboard one
  (1.5) (#4758). An unrecognised action ID from a hand-edited settings document
  or an external controller is now validated before dispatch and short-circuits
  as a harmless no-op (#4834).

- **Manual MIDI binding entry and per-row editing (#4790).** A **Manual…**
  button beside Learn types in a binding's channel (Any / 1–16), message type
  and note/CC number directly, and a ✎ button on each row reopens the same form
  pre-filled to correct a binding Learn captured wrong — without re-learning.
  Learn is unchanged and remains the default flow; the settings format is
  untouched, so a file written by this build loads in older ones. A
  duplicate-source guard catches the case where two bindings on one source
  silently leave only the last one working. Verified on a HaliKey MIDI with a
  paddle on the key jack.

### TCI

- **A use-after-free in the DAX RX path (#4789).** The path kept a `const
  float*` into its accumulation buffer, then cleared and squeezed that buffer
  before gain conversion and frame construction. The deterministic trigger is a
  client switching from a resampled rate such as 48 kHz to native 24 kHz with
  sub-threshold samples still staged. Reproduced under ASan as
  `heap-use-after-free` on the parent commit.

- **Malformed `volume:` and `modulation:` input is rejected, not reinterpreted
  (#4848).** `volume:` with an empty argument parsed to `0.0` — and 0 dB is the
  *top* of the volume range, so the malformed command landed on the loudest
  value it can express. An unrecognised modulation name fell through a
  `QMap::value(key, "USB")` default and silently set USB, while the notification
  echoed the client's own wrong name, producing two conflicting broadcasts a
  second client cannot reconcile. Both now match the ignore-silently posture the
  parser already takes for unrecognised commands.

- **The `aether.cat` log category names TCI (#4761).** It was labelled
  "CAT/rigctld" in Support & Diagnostics, which names the minority user:
  `TciServer.cpp` is 53 of the category's 76 call sites, 69.7%. An operator
  chasing a TCI problem scanned the checkbox grid, saw no mention of TCI, and
  reasonably concluded there was no TCI logging to turn on. Relabelled to
  "TCI / CAT / rigctld" — labels only, since the id is what filter rules and
  saved preferences are built from.

### Windows

- **`vcomp140.dll` ships app-local (#4782).** `AetherSDR.exe` genuinely imports
  the MSVC OpenMP runtime — ggml is compiled with `/openmp` and the prebuilt
  whisper libs are linked straight in — and our packaging never shipped it.
  `stage-msvc-runtime.ps1` searched only `Microsoft.VC*.CRT`, which does not
  hold `vcomp140.dll`; `windeployqt` was invoked without `--compiler-runtime`.
  So we shipped everything else app-local and left this one file as the single
  machine-wide dependency in the entire payload — any other installer that
  repaired, downgraded or removed the VC++ redistributable took AetherSDR down,
  and reinstalling AetherSDR could not fix it. All three artifacts were
  affected. The OpenMP redist is now staged as a *sibling* of the chosen CRT
  directory, so the two cannot diverge into a version mismatch, and a missing
  one is a hard failure. **New `check-deploy-dependencies.ps1` CI gate** walks
  every PE in the payload and fails when an MSVC runtime import is not
  app-local — checked *before* the System32 probe, because build machines have
  the redistributable installed, which is exactly how this shipped unnoticed
  through every release since ASR landed. The gate runs before any artifact is
  built.

### Linux

- **The Connect to Radio dialog reopens reliably under xcb (#4803).** Once
  connected the dialog auto-hides, and reopening it called `show()`
  successfully — `isVisible()` reported `true` — yet nothing appeared, not even
  in the window switcher, making it impossible to disconnect. Confirmed with
  `xprop`: the second show left the window wedged in the ICCCM `Withdrawn`
  `WM_STATE` under Mutter/XWayland, genuinely unmapped. The native window is now
  destroyed and recreated before every re-show, and `raise()`/`activateWindow()`
  deferred to an event-loop turn since both call sites reach this from inside a
  live X11 grab context. Matters because `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` is the practical
  workaround for #4725's native-Wayland render stalls, which look like a Qt
  platform-plugin defect rather than anything AetherSDR controls.

### GUI & workflow

- **Thumbnail view for the Choose Background Image dialog (#4726).** The dialog
  must use Qt's non-native file picker for theming, which shows only generic
  per-filetype icons. Two Explorer-style view buttons switch between small icons
  and real decoded thumbnails, with a preview pane that grows with the dialog
  instead of staying pinned. Decoding happens off the GUI thread with the same
  decompression-bomb guard used for callsign photos, cached in a bounded
  mtime-keyed cache, and the filter widens to every format `QImageReader` can
  decode.

- **The analog power gauge picks the right scale at connect (#4845).** On an
  AU-520 the meter came up on the 120 W scale every time and only corrected
  after a band change. `updatePowerScale()` was wired to signals but never
  called once at connect, and the AU- branch that bumps the scale hangs off a
  `maxPowerLevelChanged` that a 100 W exciter limit does not move against the
  100 W default. It now also runs on `infoChanged`, with each gauge
  early-returning when nothing actually changed so a status burst during a
  slider drag costs nothing.

- **The FFTW wisdom popup stopped strobing (#4729).** A deliberate infinite
  opacity animation past 90% caused the reported flashing and, supplying no
  elapsed time or status, left a slow process still looking frozen. Replaced
  with a low-key activity indicator, a monotonic elapsed timer, and a
  "still working" explanation after 10 quiet seconds. One tracked dialog is
  reused, so repeated NR2 requests cannot spawn a second worker, and the window
  stays visible on macOS when AetherSDR is not frontmost.

- **The PGXL fan-mode dropdown fits its widest item (#4731, #4752).** Its
  hand-rolled stylesheet set a 10px font on the combo but not on its popup —
  a separate top-level window that does not inherit it — and nothing let the
  combo's width grow to its widest item, so on a large enough default font
  "Fan: Contest" was elided. Root cause and fix worked out by the triage bot on
  the issue.

- **Every model-lifetime callback is installed once (#4599, #4626).**
  `RadioModel::setupBackend()` is rerunnable, but two of its self-connections
  were owned by the `RadioModel` rather than the replaceable backend, so every
  Flex → HL2 → Sim family switch accumulated another capability publication and
  TX-power push. Both are now installed once in the constructor, with the sweep
  extended to the three `TransmitModel` senders that have the same ownership
  shape.

### Tests & tooling

- **`hl2_tx_loopback_test` runs green, and the exclusion is retired (#4800).**
  It had been carried in `HERMES.md` and the multi-DDC test matrix as
  "pre-existing, fails non-deterministically, exclude it". The "pre-existing"
  call was right and everything else was a misdiagnosis — **it was never a
  transmit fault**. The test asserted the tone appears *below* centre, which was
  correct when written, but #4471 added the receive-side conjugation and from
  that commit the same tone correctly reads *above* centre. The
  "non-determinism" was a hardcoded `192.168.1.12`, which on this LAN belongs to
  a different machine — the test was silently driving *that* box's simulator.
  Fixed properly rather than by flipping a sign: the test now takes an
  independent bearing on the receive end using hpsdrsim's own scene tones before
  believing anything the transmitter puts in the spectrum, because the loop
  conjugates twice and a handedness error at both ends cancels exactly. It also
  **refuses to key anything that is not the simulator** — it defaults to
  loopback and fingerprints the responder's synthetic MAC, skipping rather than
  failing when it finds a real radio.

- **An undefined downcast that aborted the sanitizer job (#4740, #4741).**
  `cellActivatedIsUnconnected()` borrowed a protected `QObject::receivers()` by
  declaring a local `Probe` subclass and `static_cast`-ing the real
  `QTableWidget` to it. No `Probe` is ever constructed, so UBSan's vptr check
  rejected it — and because the workflow builds with
  `-fno-sanitize-recover=undefined`, the finding **aborted the process before a
  single result line was printed**. Access control was the only constraint that
  needed satisfying, not the object model: a pointer-to-member formed inside the
  derived class does the job with no fake type and no cast of the instance.

### Documentation

- **`HidEncoderManager::reportSize()` documents that it bounds a write
  (#4820).** Its return value is passed straight to `hid_read()` as the length
  bound on a write into a fixed 64-byte buffer, so overriding this virtual is
  quietly a memory-safety decision — and the declaration said nothing about it.
  Nothing to fix today (all six parsers return ≤ 64), but `TMate2Parser` returns
  *exactly* 64, so the headroom is zero rather than comfortable. Comment only.

- `HERMES.md` gains §22 on WDSP channel-open cost and FFTW wisdom, an AM/SAM DC
  pedestal subsection in §5, and a corrected §14.6 on what the transmit loopback
  structurally could not have caught. `docs/CERTIFICATION.md` gains lessons
  1.19–1.31 from the Icom bring-up — the first radio brought up with `radiocert`
  in hand rather than after the fact. New design notes for the SPE amplifier,
  the Icom CI-V backend, and HL2 frequency calibration.

## [v26.8.1] — 2026-08-02

### Hermes-Lite 2 grows up · settings move to SQLite · capability-gated UI · Qt 6.8 across every build · TCI PTT routing fixed

118 commits since v26.7.4.1. The bulk of the work is on the **Hermes-Lite 2**,
which arrived experimental in v26.7.4 and now runs **four independent
receivers**, a complete **SSB voice chain**, **CW and RTTY decoding**, **AX.25
packet** including a mailbox proven on the air, **band switching with hardware
filters and preamp**, **memory channels**, and a **Radio Health dialog** that
reports what the radio is actually doing rather than what it was asked to do.
It remembers where you left it, per radio. FlexRadio remains the supported
target and nothing here changes the Flex path, but the gap between the two has
closed a long way.

Underneath that, two structural changes. **Client settings moved to SQLite**
(RFC #4603) — transactional saves, integrity checks, verified backups,
credentials out of settings and into the OS keychain, a `--config` command line
for repairing a store that won't start, and a **Settings Browser** for reading
and editing the whole thing. And **`RadioCapabilities` now gates the UI**: every
Flex-only surface hides itself on a backend that has no such thing, declared by
what the concept *is* rather than by which radio is plugged in.

The build got the same treatment. **Qt 6.8.3 LTS is now the floor and the pin
everywhere** — the CI image, both AppImage architectures, the Windows installer
and both macOS legs — so one Qt version covers every check and every artifact.
Along the way the Apple Silicon DMG stopped taking whatever Qt Homebrew was
publishing that day, the ARM AppImage stopped falling back to CPU spectrum
drawing, and the Linux AppImage started running natively on Wayland.

Rounding it out: **TCI PTT keys the slice the client asked for** — the fault two
operators reported across v26.7.3 and v26.7.4 was four separate defects — the
**theme system's compiled fallback table is now generated** rather than
hand-maintained (it had drifted on 9 tokens and was missing 25 more), **RN2 no
longer pumps on binaural and diversity audio**, and there is a broad wave of
metering, squelch, demo-mode, macOS, Windows and accessibility fixes.

**The Intel Mac build trades a feature for reach:** it runs on **macOS 12.0**
again, and gives up **speech-to-text** to get there — the speech runtime is
published at a macOS 15.5 floor that most Intel Macs will never reach, and one
library's floor becomes the whole bundle's. Apple Silicon is unaffected; see
*macOS* below.

### Hermes-Lite 2

- **Four independent receivers (#4545).** Up to four DDCs, each with its own
  NCO, slice, WDSP channel, demodulated audio, S-meter and panadapter, added
  and closed at runtime through *Add Panadapter* and the pane close button.
  Before this the backend ran one receiver and the count was fixed at connect.
  The HL2 has one AD9866, so some things are shared by the hardware rather than
  by choice: sample rate is one register field, which means every pan shows the
  same span, and LNA gain, band and antenna are radio-wide. Mode, passband, AGC
  and frequency are per receiver. Both axes ride one 100BASE-T link — four
  receivers are available through 192 kHz, three at 384 kHz.

- **Band switching, hardware filters and hardware preamp (#4503).** The band
  sidebar resolved a Flex band-stack key and sent a command the HL2 has no
  plane for, so the button moved, the setting persisted, and nothing reached
  the hardware. The app is now authoritative on a backend without a Flex
  command plane and tunes the slice directly. The same root cause affected the
  hardware LPF/BPF filter selection and the preamp.

- **Radio Health dialog (#4503, #4696).** A per-backend health view reporting
  what the radio itself says — link, temperature, supply, PA current, gateware
  — rather than what the client asked for. It grew a **Transmit voice chain**
  section covering mic level and applied gain, mic peak for the current over,
  the ALC hold threshold, ALC gain and post-ALC peak, the passband in use, and
  both instantaneous and held forward power.

- **The SSB voice chain is wired (#4609).** The EQ applet, PROC, the Phone
  applet's TX low-cut and high-cut, eSSB, and the ALC and Compression gauges
  were all controls that did nothing on this radio — each turns operator intent
  into a Flex command-plane verb, and none of those reach anything without a
  Flex command plane. None of it needed new DSP: the Aetherial chain already
  runs on the HL2's transmit audio and the modulator already computed an ALC
  gain nothing was reading. They are now connected to it.

- **CW, RTTY and the QSO recorder work (#4537).** All three bound directly to
  the panadapter stream's audio signal, which early-returns when there is no
  stream — so on a radio that demodulates in-process they bound to *nothing*.
  No error, no log line: the toggle worked, the panel opened, and nothing ever
  decoded. All three now ride one normalized `rxDemodAudioReady` signal.

- **AX.25 packet — APRS, the KISS TNC, the terminal and the mailbox (#4661).**
  Proven on the air between an HL2 mailbox and a FlexRadio terminal on
  21.100 MHz: two complete BBS sessions, messages left and retrieved, both
  ending in a graceful disconnect. AetherModem transmit previously required a
  FlexRadio DAX stream and simply hung on any radio without one — PTT never
  engaged and every queued frame was lost when the window closed.

  Connected-mode reliability improved with it, on every radio:

  - **Timers are derived from the air interface** instead of hardcoded. The old
    fixed 6-second retransmit timeout was shorter than the 6.8 seconds it takes
    to send one full-size frame at 300 baud, so every HF frame timed out before
    its acknowledgement could physically arrive and the link died. On HF the
    packet length now defaults to 64 bytes as well — at 300 baud a 128-byte
    frame is four seconds of continuous transmission, and a single bit error
    costs the whole frame.
  - **A lost acknowledgement no longer kills the session.** A repeated frame was
    treated as a gap in the sequence and answered with silence, so one dropped
    acknowledgement was unrecoverable. Repeats are now acknowledged again.
  - **Sessions no longer stall or hang.** A connected link can't come to rest
    with data still queued; an idle link is polled so a station that disappears
    can't hold the mailbox open against every other caller (it previously stayed
    locked out until restarted); and a peer that keeps rejecting can no longer
    make us retransmit indefinitely.
  - **Stopping means stopping.** Pressing BYE a second time now ends a
    disconnect instead of restarting it — repeated presses previously kept the
    radio transmitting. Switching the modem off now halts transmission and drops
    any session, where before it stopped only the decoder and kept keying.
  - **AX.25 v2.2 callers connect immediately.** A SABME connect request is
    answered rather than ignored, so v2.2 stations fall back to v2.0 at once
    instead of retrying until they give up.
  - **New Terminal controls**: Retry, Paclen and TXDELAY default to **Auto**,
    derived from the current modem profile, and remain overridable. A session's
    measured round-trip time is shown in `STATUS` and recorded in the log, which
    is what tells a mis-sized timeout apart from a poor channel.

- **Memory channels on radios that have none (#4590).** Memory was built on
  four commands the client sends the radio, so on an HL2 saving a channel did
  nothing, the browse panel stayed empty, and the memory-spot feed had no
  memories to draw. Channels are now stored on the host when the backend
  declares it has no slots of its own — with no change to the memory dialog,
  the browse panel, the CSV codec or the spot feed. The bank is deliberately
  *shared* across every memory-less radio (HL2, KiwiSDR, demo), like the
  shack's paper log, rather than scoped per radio (#4623).

- **The radio remembers where you left it, per radio (#4619).** Frequency,
  mode, passband and span/sample-rate are restored per MAC address, so two
  HL2s — or an HL2 and a Radioberry — keep independent state. **TX drive and
  LNA gain are remembered per band**, so the drive that makes 5 W on 80 m no
  longer follows you to 10 m, on restore or on a band change.

- **Live connection health (#4607).** The title-bar status indicator stayed
  amber for a whole session instead of blinking green on a live connection, and
  connection health on the status bar and in the Network Statistics pane was
  blank or all zeros — none of it was a bug in those surfaces, they simply had
  no source on a backend with no panadapter stream. All three now read from the
  backend's own link statistics. No behaviour change on the FlexRadio path.

- **The MIC slider reached nothing, and the wattmeter read voice ~3.5 dB low
  (#4696).** Reported from the bench as 6 W out on FT8 and WSPR but never more
  than 1 W on SSB voice, at every mic and RF level, with and without the
  compressor. Three faults, and the first is why the other two were invisible.

  *The wattmeter was measuring the wrong thing on voice.* Forward power was
  published as the raw instantaneous sample from the HL2's directional coupler
  — one 12-bit conversion from the `slow_adc` I2C converter, round-robined with
  reverse power, temperature and bias current, with no peak detector and no
  averaging anywhere in the gateware, reaching us at 10 Hz. Speech peaks last
  tens of milliseconds, so sampling that envelope at 10 Hz lands on a peak
  essentially never, while a constant-envelope FT8 or WSPR transmission — where
  every instant *is* the peak — read full scale. The same transmitter making the
  same power read very differently depending on what was modulating it. It is
  now published through a peak hold (instant attack, ~2 s release, in watts
  because the calibration curve is markedly non-linear). This does not recover
  an instantaneous PEP reading — no filter can recover a peak that was never
  sampled — it accumulates the maximum across a transmission, so the reading
  climbs toward PEP as the over goes on; the meter is labelled "peak estimate"
  rather than claiming to be a measurement. Measured on a live HL2 into a dummy
  load, voice peaks now read **4.6 W where they read 1.7 W before**, and a
  constant carrier is unchanged (2.642 W held against 2.637 W instantaneous),
  which is the control case a hold must not inflate. `MeterModel`'s own
  ballistics are untouched, so no Flex behaviour changes.

  *Mic gain was wired to nothing.* The Phone applet's MIC slider emits a Flex
  `transmit set miclevel=` verb, which a backend with no command plane drops,
  and nothing bridged it to the host modulator — so sweeping the slider end to
  end changed nothing on the air. The client-side fallback could not fire
  either, being gated on a `mic_selection` an HL2 never reports. The slider now
  reaches the modulator's pre-ALC gain through the same seam the TX passband
  uses, with 50 as unity so an untouched slider leaves every existing install
  exactly where it was. This is what carries a quiet microphone over the ALC's
  hold threshold, which is what the "raise mic gain" diagnostic has been
  advising since it shipped — at a control that did nothing on this backend.

  *And the readback agreed with the failure.* Every readback available while mic
  gain was dead reported the requesting side, so all of them agreed the control
  worked. A confirmation sourced from the requester cannot detect a request that
  never arrived. The modulator now echoes its own gain.

- **TUNE keys at TUNE power, not RF power (#4551).** Set RF Power 100 and Tune
  Power 10 — an ordinary configuration — press TUNE, and the radio keyed at
  100 into whatever was connected, for as long as tune was held. That is the
  opposite of what the control exists for. The Tune Power slider now reaches
  the drive register.

- **"Auto-reconnect to last radio" works (#4507).** Saved-radio autoconnect was
  wired to the FlexRadio discovery signal only. An HL2 arrives on a completely
  separate UDP sweep and never appeared there, so every launch meant watching
  the radio show up in the connect list and clicking it by hand, with "Looking
  for your radio…" on screen the whole time.

- **Connect by IP asks which radio you are dialing (#4528).** The page probed
  for an HL2 first and fell through to the Flex probe, so every Flex connect
  paid the HL2 timeout and an HL2 operator got no signal about which protocol
  had been tried when a connect failed. A **Radio type** dropdown now selects
  the family and probes exactly that one. This is what makes an HL2 reachable
  over a VPN, where discovery broadcast does not cross.

- **Connect no longer leaves the passband disagreeing with the mode (#4484).**
  A fresh connect came up in USB carrying DIGU's passband while the mode
  indicator read USB the whole time — the unmapped-mode fallback happened to
  match the backend's member default, so only a real mode *change* re-derived
  it. Found by the radio bring-up diagnostic's mode-map stage.

- **The Display ▸ WtrFall Rate slider ran backwards (#4606).** The control is a
  rate — 1 slow, 100 fast — but it travels under FlexRadio's `line_duration`
  wire name, which is typed as milliseconds. On a radio whose waterfall this
  client paces itself, the number was read literally, so 1 gave the fastest
  scroll and 100 the slowest. 100 is the default, which meant every HL2 session
  started on the slowest setting at about 10 rows/second. The slider now runs
  the right way and is linear in rows per second: 0.2 rows/s at the bottom, and
  at the top the waterfall simply tracks the panadapter's frame rate (which
  Display ▸ FFT FPS owns) — measured at 25 rows/s on a real HL2. Half-way up the
  slider is now half speed, which it never was. FlexRadio radios are unaffected:
  their own display engine has always done this conversion.

  *Adaptive network throttling had the same unit confusion one layer up*: the
  throttle converted its frame-rate cap straight into a duration and sent it as
  a rate, so a "Poor" 4 fps cap asked for the *fastest* waterfall setting
  available. Worse network, faster waterfall.

  *And the waterfall Black Level button offered a hardware mode on radios that
  have no such thing.* `HW` hands the black-level decision to the radio, which
  only FlexRadio hardware computes. On an HL2, selecting it sent a command
  nowhere and left the waterfall waiting for a level that never arrived. The
  button now cycles `Off ↔ SW` on radios without it. If you chose `HW` on a
  FlexRadio, that choice is **remembered, not overwritten**.

- **AetherClock decodes on the HL2 (#4615).** It gated its audio connect on the
  panadapter stream, which a backend that demodulates in-process does not have,
  so the engine started and no PCM ever arrived. The applet's amber "Bound
  slice has no DAX channel — no audio" was the closest thing to a diagnosis,
  and it named the wrong cause.

- **The status bar labels the gateware version, and fits a long nickname on one
  line (#4596).** The HL2 reports a gateware revision, which the status bar
  printed as a bare number under the model name, with nothing saying what it
  counted.

### Client settings store moved to SQLite (RFC #4603)

- **Settings now live in a SQLite database** (`AetherSDR.db` in the config
  folder) instead of the XML file (#4612). The switch is automatic and verified
  on first launch; your old `AetherSDR.settings` stays in place untouched, so
  rolling back to an older release keeps the settings you had at upgrade time
  (changes made after the upgrade stay with the new version).
- **Safer storage**: transactional saves (no more full-file rewrites), startup
  integrity checks, automatic verified backups, and quarantine + restore if the
  store is ever damaged — with a notice telling you which backup was used.
  Reset Settings now writes a final backup before wiping. Fixes a latent
  threading race in the settings core (#4602).
- **Credentials are never stored in settings anymore.** The MQTT password,
  automation-bridge token, and remote-ASR API key move to your OS keychain
  automatically during the upgrade.
- **New `--config` command line**: `aethersdr --config list|get|set|unset|
  export|path` inspects or repairs settings without starting the GUI — the
  escape hatch when a broken stored value prevents startup.
- **Per-radio feature documents (#4614).** Radio-scoped configuration is stored
  as one versioned JSON document per (family, radio, feature), with reads
  falling back exact-radio → family-wide → empty, and writes committed whole in
  a single transaction. This is what carries the HL2's operating-state restore
  (#4619) and the band stack.
- **Bookmarks are durable the moment you make them (#4621).** The BandStack
  moves to per-radio feature documents with write-through persistence; the
  separate `save()` step is gone, so a bookmark no longer rides on a later
  explicit save that a crash could beat. Existing bookmarks are claimed from
  the legacy store lazily, on first touch.
- **New Settings Browser** (Settings ▸ Settings Browser…) (#4631): browse and
  edit the whole settings store — app keys, the station section, and each
  radio's stored feature documents — with live filtering, guarded editing
  (True/False picker, JSON validation, confirmations), and a sanitized
  diagnostic export. Credential-shaped values are masked and read-only; a store
  from a newer version browses read-only.

### Radio capabilities — the UI follows what the radio can do

- **Flex-only UI hides itself on non-Flex backends (#4508).** The PROF applet
  and Profile Manager, DAX, the ATU chain, SmartLink, and the rest are each
  gated on a declared `RadioCapabilities` field named for the *concept* — not
  on a call site asking "is this a Flex". Every surface that a backend cannot
  serve is now absent rather than present-and-inert.
- **GPS presence is gated on both the family capability and the live unit
  (#4632, #4538).** A Flex with the GPSDO option not fitted no longer shows a
  GPS stack, and a capability declaration is no longer mistaken for installed
  hardware. Both `gpsdo_present` and `gnss_present` are recognised, without
  latching stale truth across sessions.
- **The status bar's PA supply voltage is gated on declared telemetry (#4597).**
  On a radio that reports no supply voltage the row still rendered — as
  `0.00 V`, a fabricated reading presented in the same style as a real one.
  Where the row is shown but nothing has arrived yet, it renders a dash rather
  than a zero.
- **The DVK button follows the radio's SmartSDR+ entitlement (#4653).** DVK
  requires a subscription and AetherSDR never checked, so on a radio without it
  the button was fully live: it opened the panel, the radio refused every
  command, and the feature read as *broken* rather than *unlicensed* — after
  the operator had already recorded into a slot that was never going to work.

### Transmit, metering & audio

- **The TX filter now says when it is removing your transmit audio (#4649).**
  A TX low/high cut that excludes the transmit audio keys the radio normally
  and produces almost no RF, and nothing connected the two. In DIGU/DIGL there
  was no cue at all — the digital application reported a normal transmit cycle
  while forward power sat at zero. The radio's own taps either side of the
  filter are now compared, and a large attenuation between them is reported.
- **Forward power stopped reporting for ~3 seconds after unkey (#4540).** The
  raw dBm meter is honest and reads zero within 200 ms, but the derived watts
  value decayed exponentially from full power — measured on a FLEX-6700 into a
  500 W dummy load, still showing 3.45 W at the moment the meter read zero.
  Reflected power, five lines below in the same function and unsmoothed, dropped
  instantly, so the two directional readings disagreed about whether the radio
  was transmitting at all.
- **SWR no longer reports a stale reading while receiving (#4533).** With no
  transmit for over sixteen minutes the meter kept showing the value measured
  during the *previous* transmit — a steady `SWR 2.88` on a station that was
  working perfectly, which reads as a live antenna fault. The staleness was
  already in the snapshot and simply was not acted on for SWR.
- **Amplifier bar gauges no longer keep painting the old scale after the range
  changes (#4636).** When a gauge's scale is re-derived from live telemetry —
  the ACOM auto-range as forward power outgrows its tier, an SPE LOW/MID/HIGH
  change — the bar moved its axis but left the fill where the *previous* axis
  had put it. A steady reading never corrected it, because an unchanged value
  is discarded before it reaches the bar, so on a held carrier the wrong fill
  persisted indefinitely. Measured on the bench: an ACOM reflected-power gauge
  showed **206 W for 120 W** after an auto-range and stayed there, and an SPE
  at a steady 1000 W read 1455 W after MID→HIGH and 688 W after HIGH→MID.
  Reflected power is the worst case, since that is the reading an operator uses
  to decide whether to stop transmitting. The fill now follows the axis
  immediately — snapped rather than swept, because the scale moved and the
  signal did not. The PA-temperature gauge's °C/°F toggle was already correct
  and is unchanged.
- **Client-side recording refuses instead of writing an empty file (#4629).**
  With PC Audio disabled, Client-Side recording produced a correctly named,
  44-byte, header-only WAV and reported success — found while recording with
  the monitoring done on the radio's own speaker rather than the PC. The only
  RX producer for the recorder is a stream that is created only when PC Audio
  is enabled.
- **AetherVoice playback, CW sidetone and Quindar tones work on
  class-compliant multichannel USB interfaces on Windows (#4641).** On devices
  like the Akai EIE, WASAPI's shared-mode format query reported the device as
  unable to play any of the negotiated formats, even though the same device was
  already playing RX audio fine. The three affected paths now open the device
  the same way the RX sink always has: try each candidate format for real and
  keep the first one that actually starts, instead of asking the query for
  permission first. Previously, pressing Record in AetherVoice on an affected
  device would mute audio and silently never play the recording back.
- **The WSPR beacon matches WSJT-X on tone convention, frame taper and slot
  timing (#4605).** The transmitted frame decoded, but differed from the
  reference implementation in four ways that each cost signal quality or
  accuracy — including a tone convention 2.2 Hz low. A WSPR frame is judged by
  decoders we do not own, so its conventions are not ours to choose; WSJT-X's
  `Modulator.cpp` is the oracle throughout. The reported symptom, "it opens the
  band in USB, not DIGU, with a very wide open filter", was real and was one of
  the five things wrong.

### RN2 (RNNoise)

- **RN2 no longer pumps on stereo and binaural receive audio (#4584).** If you
  listen to RN2 with binaural or diversity receive audio, the noise floor no
  longer rises every time someone talks. Nothing changes for duplicated-mono
  slices, and nothing changes in how much noise RN2 removes.

  RN2 used to denoise an L/R downmix, derive a gain envelope from the result and
  re-apply that one envelope to the original stereo. That is exact when the two
  channels are proportional to their sum — plain mono, and simple panning — but
  binaural and diversity audio are not: the downmix has comb-filter nulls the
  individual channels do not, so the envelope fits neither channel. The audible
  result was the noise floor breathing with speech, loud under voice and gated
  between phrases. RN2 now runs one RNNoise instance and one matched resampler
  pair per receive channel, driven from the same block so the two stay in
  lockstep. Pan, stereo balance, diversity and binaural phase all survive it. A
  regression test mixes a steady tone into binaural speech and measures its level
  during speech against the gaps: the old path modulated it ~15x, the new one
  ~1.0x.

  The transmit denoiser is unchanged — it still downmixes to mono, which is what
  a microphone path wants.

- **RN2 can leave a noise floor instead of going silent between phrases.**
  **New, off by default:** *AetherDSP → RN2 → Noise Floor*. RNNoise gates hard,
  which some operators hear as the receiver going dead rather than quiet. Raising
  this leaves that percentage of the original signal under the denoised audio, so
  the band still sounds live between phrases. 0% is what RN2 has always done and
  remains the default; 10–20% is a usable floor. Receive only.

  The blend happens inside RNNoise, before its synthesis and overlap-add stage,
  rather than by mixing a dry copy of the waveform back in afterwards — mixing
  two waveforms that have been through different delays comb filters, and the
  whole point is a floor you stop noticing.

- **Transmit audio no longer breaks up with RN2 enabled (#4584).** RN2 runs on
  the same event loop as the 10 ms remote-audio TX pacing timer. When RN2
  delayed that loop, Qt coalesced the missed timer events while the callback
  emitted only one packet per delivered timeout, so the pacer could never repay
  a lost deadline — recovered microphone frames accumulated until the 20-packet
  cap discarded audio outright. A new pacer follows elapsed deadlines and drains
  up to three packets per callback for bounded catch-up, so the stream stays
  unbroken even if the queue does overflow. An overflow is now written to the
  log instead of failing silently — the old behaviour left no trace in a support
  bundle, which is why this kept arriving as unexplained "audio break up". Live
  pacing counters are exposed to the automation bridge (`get audio` →
  `opusTxPacing`) for diagnosing future reports.

  Reported by @Bill6000 on a FLEX-6500 under Linux Mint.

### Receive & squelch

- **Manual squelch is remembered per slice again, on every path (#3326,
  #4592).** Each slice keeps its own manual squelch threshold, but only the RX
  applet was keeping that memory current. Setting the level any other way —
  from a non-active slice's own VFO flag, a MIDI or controller squelch knob, or
  from the radio itself (your own edit on another client, or the radio's session
  restore) — left the remembered value stale, so the next time you cycled the
  SQL button that stale value was pushed back to the radio and quietly undid
  what you had set. Every route now keeps the live level and the remembered one
  together, and levels the radio reports back update it too — except while Auto
  is computing them, so Auto's tracking of the noise floor no longer overwrites
  the threshold you chose by hand. Switching squelch off and back on returns you
  to your own level rather than the Auto margin.
- **Squelch is no longer saved between sessions (#4592).** Squelch belongs to
  the radio, and AetherSDR was also keeping its own copy. On a FLEX that copy
  was never read back — the radio reports the real level on every connect — so
  it only added a settings write each time you moved the slider, and risked
  fighting the radio on reconnect. New slices now start from the radio's own
  level, and the leftover setting is removed from existing installs on first
  launch.
- **The CW APF level slider follows APF engagement (#4658).** With APF
  disengaged the slider still dragged, the value label still updated, and the
  command still went to the radio — while the audio was untouched. Every other
  DSP parameter in the app is unreachable until its filter is on; APF predates
  that convention and has now joined it.

### Spectrum, waterfall & 3D FFT

- **The waterfall recolours its history when you change the palette (#4694).**
  Picking a new waterfall Scheme now recolours the waterfall you are already
  looking at, instead of only the rows that arrive next. Previously the palette
  change took effect at the waterline: everything above it kept the old colours,
  so comparing two schemes meant waiting for the display to scroll clear. The 3D
  spectrum has always recoloured immediately — the 2D waterfall now matches it.

  Switching *themes* does the same thing, for the same reason: the theme owns the
  gradient behind every preset, so a theme change is a palette change.

  Nothing moves while it happens. The waterfall keeps its scroll position, its
  paused scrollback, and its place in the scroll animation — the retained rows
  were always stored as palette-independent intensity, so recolouring is a
  repaint of what is on screen, the same work a pan already does, and the
  scrollback above the viewport recolours as you scroll it back in.

- **3D FFT and waterfall history stabilised (#4539).** Repeated zoom, pan, band
  changes and window resizing still exposed several coupled problems in the
  shared display pipeline after the v26.7.4 pass: the 3D surface could develop
  false spikes or flat floor sections, peaks and boundary rows could bounce while
  scrolling, the surface could shimmer or strobe, pan previews could move faster
  than the waterfall and snap back on release, and newly exposed frequencies
  could stay blank even though the radio was already sending wider native tiles.
- **Fixed a stack overflow that could crash the app on a waterfall source
  switch (#4595).** `WaterfallStreamState` held a `DssRenderer` by value —
  ~801 KB of fixed row buffers — and both the save and restore paths
  materialised stack-local copies to shuffle state between the live renderer and
  the saved per-source slots, sometimes two alive at once.
- **A band change can no longer black out the waterfall (#4522).** FLEX band
  persistence removes and recreates slices during a band change, and the radio
  can transiently mark a surviving old-band slice active during that
  reconstruction. AetherSDR treated that as an ordinary selection and revealed
  the off-screen slice, sending a pan-centre command that could undo the
  radio-authoritative band change — frames kept arriving, but the old-band tiles
  no longer overlapped the new frequency range, producing a completely black
  waterfall.
- **The AetherVoice channel-strip waveform no longer starves the waterfall
  (#4616).** It independently requested GPU repaints at 90 Hz, on the same
  render thread as the panadapter and with work that grows with the strip width,
  so enlarging the channel strip consumed render time the waterfall needed. It
  now matches the standalone WAVE applet's 25 Hz cadence.

### KiwiSDR

- **RX audio stays warm (still muted) through transmit (#4380).** Running an
  RX-only KiwiSDR on one panadapter while transmitting from a Flex-backed slice
  on another cost about a second of silence on every unkey, followed by an
  audible re-sync. The transmit mute was destructive: it dropped every incoming
  packet at the feed gate, wiped the jitter buffers on both PTT edges and reset
  the NR/DSP state, so each unkey had to re-prime a 360 ms jitter buffer and let
  NR re-converge from cold. There is a per-profile **Keep audio during TX**
  option.
- **New per-profile "Resume audio after TX delay" (#4571)** — suppresses the
  operator's own transmit tail after unkey, on receivers far enough away to hear
  it late.
- **A tuned carrier in CW is audible again (#4423).** KiwiSDR's `SET … freq=`
  is the BFO/mixdown point, not a dial frequency, and the low/high cuts are an
  audio passband applied *relative to it* — so sending the carrier frequency put
  the carrier at 0 Hz, either outside the passband (no tone) or landing as an
  inaudible DC thump. The BFO is now offset by the radio's CW pitch.
- **A Kiwi pan keeps its zoom through a tune-driven recentre (#4424).** On a
  panadapter whose slice uses a KiwiSDR virtual antenna, zooming in and then
  dragging the slice flag snapped the pan back to the zoom level it had when the
  Kiwi antenna was assigned — visibly zooming back out mid-drag.

### TCI

- **TCI PTT now keys the slice the client asked for (#4547).** Since v26.7.4 no
  TCI client could activate the slice it named: the requested receiver was
  discarded on every request whose slice was not already the transmit slice —
  the common path, not an edge case — so keying stayed pinned to wherever
  transmit already sat. Before that, in v26.7.3 and earlier, the opposite held:
  every client's `trx:0` promoted the first slice, so a second WSJT-X instance
  yanked transmit off the slice the first one was working. Both are fixed. An
  externally selected transmit slice still answers instead, but only when a
  route actually applies — split was requested, or VFO B bound a route for that
  exact receiver — so satellite and cross-band split are preserved.

  Three further faults in the same path go with it. A cached route can no
  longer outlive the live transmit slice, which previously let a bare keypress
  move transmit onto a stale slice's **band and antenna** with no operator
  action. An unresolvable receiver is now declined instead of transmitting on
  the first slice. And with two clients on one radio, each resolves against the
  receiver it declared in `audio_start` when it sends the ambiguous `trx:0`
  that every WSJT-X instance sends — an explicitly addressed receiver is always
  honoured as sent.

  Every PTT refusal now replies `trx:<n>,false;` instead of returning in
  silence, including when a second client keys while another already holds TCI
  PTT. WSJT-X reports those as "TCI failed to set ptt"; they previously arrived
  with no cause at all.

- **Receiver numbers are stable across a slice recreate (#4567).** After a slice
  is genuinely closed mid-session, surviving slices now keep their receiver
  numbers and the freed number is reused by the next new slice; the old
  positional policy shifted every later slice down, invalidating a live client's
  binding. Sessions with no mid-session destroy/recreate are numbered exactly as
  before.

- **The PTT slice-routing decision is now logged (#4547).** Reports of TCI
  keying the wrong slice have been arriving without logs because there were
  none to send: the server logged audio, IQ, DAX and client connections, but
  the decision that picks which slice transmits was silent. One line now
  records the whole decision — the requested receiver, the slice it maps to,
  the slice that was chosen and whether that is the one asked for, the slice
  that actually holds transmit, and the cached route it was compared against —
  which separates the three failure modes behind #4547 that otherwise look
  identical to an operator. Slice ids are printed with their receiver number
  (`0(trx0)`) so the line can be read against a client's own transcript.

  It is off by default; turn it on with
  `QT_LOGGING_RULES="aether.cat.info=true"` before starting AetherSDR, and
  include the output when reporting a TCI routing problem. Three cases that
  previously dropped a PTT request with no trace — unresolvable receiver,
  resolved slice gone, and transmit-inhibited panadapter — now say so at the
  normal logging level, no rule needed.

### Themes

- **The compiled fallback table is now generated from the bundled theme
  (#3184, #4582, #4570).** AetherSDR compiles a copy of the default theme into
  the binary as a fallback for tokens a theme file doesn't define. That table
  was maintained by hand and had drifted: it said slice A was red (`#ff4040`)
  while both bundled themes say cyan (`#00d4ff`), and eight more slice colours
  disagreed the same way. If your theme predates the slice tokens you will see
  the corrected — cyan — palette. Themes that define their own slice colours are
  unaffected.

  **24 tokens that had no compiled fallback at all now have one.** The dimmed
  slice colours, the highlight and disabled-button colours, and all six
  waterfall colormap gradients previously resolved to *transparent* on a theme
  that predated them. On such a theme the waterfall could render with no
  colormap; it now falls back to the bundled Default Dark gradients.

  The table is generated from `resources/themes/default-dark.json` by
  `tools/gen_theme_seed.py` and pinned in CI, so the two can no longer disagree.

- **Three silent round-trip losses in save / export / template resolve
  (#4573).** Radial gradients lost their centre on every save — the writer
  emitted two scalars where the reader, and the file format's own documented
  shape, expect an array. Each of the three failures lost data without reporting
  anything: the file still loaded and the stylesheet still applied, so nothing
  announced the loss.
- **"Reset to default" restored dark values while editing a light theme
  (#4575).** The factory snapshot was hardcoded to the dark theme and latched
  once, so pressing Reset on Default Light restored the dark value for 96 of the
  147 root tokens the two bundled themes share. Theme names also can no longer
  be interpreted as filesystem paths.
- **A themed widget reparented after it was styled is re-resolved (#4520).**
  The frequency display's font reverted to the default after a band change: the
  re-resolve filter was installed only on tracked widgets, so when an *untracked
  ancestor* was reparented the tracked child inside it heard nothing.
- **A colour ratchet in CI (#4569).** Colour *references* are down about 22%
  against the documented baseline while unique colours went *up* by ~105 — new
  one-offs were being minted faster than old ones collapsed. The scanner had
  three defects of its own (including counting issue references as colours),
  fixed first so the baseline is real, and CI now gates on the counts.

### Demo mode

- **Demo mode no longer opens with a ghost "Slice A" panadapter (#4671).** The
  demo's simulator claims its panadapter from its own synthetic wire, but the
  model treated every non-Flex backend as wire-less and minted a *second*,
  ownerless pan in the neutral id space on the seam's geometry edge — a pane the
  user could neither use nor delete. The same assumption re-addressed the demo's
  slice into that neutral space, so the slice pointed at the ghost rather than
  at its real pan; with the ghost gone it would have pointed at nothing. Both
  now key off whether the backend vends its own connection, so the demo opens
  with one panadapter and a slice that belongs to it — restoring the pan title
  bar, adaptive RX filter, auto-squelch, centre-lock and band recall on demo
  mode. Hermes-Lite 2 and other wire-less backends keep the neutral mapping.
- **The CW tone clicked instead of sliding when you moved its pitch slider
  (#4618).** The tone was synthesized from absolute time × the current pitch, so
  every notch of **CW tone** in the Demo applet jumped the oscillator's phase
  rather than changing its frequency — a hard click mid-dah, which is exactly
  the artifact the generator's raised-cosine key edges exist to prevent. The
  jump grows with how long the session has been running, so after half a minute
  even a 1 Hz nudge is a full-amplitude step. The tone now accumulates phase per
  sample, the way the birdie carrier already did. Fixed alongside it: three of
  the mixer's sample counters were 32-bit on Windows and hit undefined behaviour
  after about 25 hours of unbroken demo audio.
- **The power-line hum clicked instead of bending when you moved its 50/60 Hz
  slider (#4668).** The hum's six harmonics were synthesized from absolute time ×
  the current mains frequency, so every move of **Power-line** jumped all six
  phases at once rather than changing their frequency — and because that jump
  scales with the harmonic number, the high harmonics stepped hardest and the
  click grew with how long the session had been running. The hum now accumulates
  phase per sample, deriving every harmonic from one shared fundamental so they
  stay locked to each other, and bends smoothly. This was the last generator in
  the demo mixer still keyed off absolute time.
- **The simulated CW channel sends proper Morse (#4593).** The element table
  conflated duration with key state, so the inter-element gaps were missing and
  the character gap keyed as a fifth dah, rendering one continuous ~600 ms tone.
  The schedule is now built from a message string with standard 1/3/7-dit
  element, character and word spacing, keeping 18 WPM, the 700 Hz default pitch
  and the 5 ms raised-cosine edges.
- **Educational tooltips on every Demo Noise source (#4669).** Each noise-source
  row explains what causes that noise on a real HF band — cause first, then what
  to do about it. The two signal rows (CW / voice) teach the complementary
  lesson: they are the *wanted* signal that NR and notch filters must preserve.
- **The Demo Noise button strips wrap instead of clipping at docked rail width
  (#4518).** Docked, the two button strips compressed past their minimum and the
  centred labels clipped at both ends to mid-word fragments. The wrap-layout fix
  from SpotHub's band-filter row (#4157) is promoted to a shared class and used
  for both.

  Demo mode changes touch no radio, protocol or transmit path.

### Automation bridge

- **New `health` verb (#4696).** Returns the backend's own health snapshot —
  the rows the Radio Health dialog shows, which until now reached nothing else
  and so were unavailable to any script or regression test. Deliberately *not*
  assembled from the models: `get` already reports those, and a model reports
  what the operator **asked for**, which is why a control whose command was
  dropped on the way to the radio could read back as working. Every row here
  comes from the backend instead, so the two can be compared and the comparison
  is the diagnosis. Read-only and TX-safe — it keys nothing and sets nothing. A
  `null` value means the radio never reported that row, kept distinct from a
  zero because "the FIFO is empty" and "we were never told" are different
  answers.
- **`tune`, `targettune` and pan centre refuse Hz passed to an MHz verb (#4550,
  #4568).** `tune 14200000` answered `ok: true` for a frequency it did not
  apply — the slice stayed where it was. All three verbs now share one guard.
- **`dumpTree` serializes a floated pan window once, not twice (#4674).** A
  floated pan's entire subtree appeared twice — two windows, two applets, two
  VFOs with the same slice id for a single slice — because the window is
  reachable both as a top-level widget and through its parent. It presented as
  a real UI duplication and cost an investigation to un-believe.

### Controllers, spotting & operator workflow

- **Stream Deck: slice targeting, connection status and radio-sourced key
  values (#4513).** Every command previously addressed `trx0`, so the plugin
  only ever drove slice A, and every key showed a static label from the
  manifest. A **Slice Target** action now cycles `TRX0 → TX → ACTIVE` across
  mode, DSP, squelch, lock, RIT/XIT, split, slice volume, slice mute and the
  VFO dial, and keys show live values from the radio. The default stays `TRX0`,
  so an existing deck behaves exactly as before.
- **Ulanzi Dial: PTT (Hold), CW keying release, and mapping persistence
  (#4611).** A dial button set to **PTT (Hold)** or a CW key did nothing at all,
  because only the button-down half of each press was being read; the button-up
  that should un-key never arrived. Press-and-hold now works for PTT, the
  straight key, both paddles, and held MIDI actions. Releases are honoured even
  when the dial reports the button and its modifier out of order, and holding
  two side buttons at once no longer leaves the first one stuck down — so the
  transmitter always comes back to receive. If the dial disconnects
  mid-transmission, everything it was holding is released immediately. Button
  mappings also survive a restart now; existing ones are carried over
  automatically the first time you run this version, and a mapping you clear
  stays cleared.
- **FlexControl recovers on its own after losing its USB port (#4574).** The
  knob driver had no error handling at all: if the serial port dropped — a USB
  glitch, a driver reset, the host reclaiming the device — nothing noticed, and
  the knob stayed dead for the rest of the session. It now detects the error,
  releases the port, and re-detects the device every couple of seconds until it
  comes back (re-detecting rather than reusing the old name, since a replug can
  hand the device a different COM port). Disconnecting from AetherControl or
  turning FlexControl off in Radio Setup still stops it for good. Enabling the
  **Ext Devices** log category now also shows the serial error at the moment the
  port drops, instead of silence.
- **The amplifier fan mode is a pull-down instead of a blind cycle button
  (#3905).** The three modes were hidden behind click-to-cycle, with no way to
  see the choices without clicking through them.
- **SpotHub gains a Freeze toggle on the Spot List tab (#4145).** New spots are
  prepended on every flush tick, so the list was unusable to click a spot
  mid-scroll. Frozen, spots keep accumulating rather than being lost, and
  unfreezing flushes immediately.
- **A collapsed VFO's right-click Add Spot captures the right frequency
  (#4455).** The collapsed frequency label never reached the VFO's own
  context-menu handler, so the click fell through to the spectrum's menu, which
  reports the cursor's step-snapped frequency rather than the VFO's actual one.
- **Repeater offset controls are visible in DSTR mode (#4240).** DSTR uses DFM
  as its underlying RF mode, but only FM, NFM and DFM were treated as the
  FM family, so entering DSTR hid the offset, direction, simplex and reverse
  controls that already drive the radio's mode-independent offset path. CTCSS
  stays hidden in DSTR.
- **The IARU Region 1 80 m band plan is corrected (#4610).** 3.600–3.620 MHz was
  classified as DIGI with the narrow-band digital colour; it is ALL, matching
  the adjacent Region 1 segment and the official IARU Region 1 band plan.
- **The Connect to Radio footer stays reachable (#4515).** The panel was one
  tall non-scrollable layout whose footer was its final item, so at Windows DPI
  and font scaling the footer clipped first. The body now scrolls and the status
  and Disconnect controls are pinned below it; the panel is also fitted to the
  screen's available geometry, frame margins included.
- **A rejected GUI client registration is now a clean failure (#4481, #4560).**
  A radio that refused `client gui` left AetherSDR continuing as an unusable
  non-GUI client, and result codes were parsed as signed values so fatal
  responses such as `F3000001` could overflow to zero and appear successful. It
  now stops post-registration setup, closes the connection, suppresses the
  automatic retry loops and returns to the Connect panel with the radio's actual
  error and recovery instructions.
- **The last-session DAX restore is confined to the post-connect window
  (#4558).** The per-slice DAX restore is keyed by list position but ran on
  every slice add. A band-stack switch destroys and recreates its slice, and the
  recreate re-enters the list at the tail — so with two slices open, the
  recreated slice resolved the *other* position's persisted key and silently
  re-assigned that stale channel to itself, stealing the surviving slice's DAX
  channel.
- **Screen readers no longer stutter on the ATU relay bars and the CW decoder
  range sliders (#4565).** With VoiceOver / NVDA / Orca running, a focused relay
  bar announced every step of an ATU tune sweep, and the decoder Pitch and WPM
  sliders announced every repeat of a held arrow key. Both now announce the
  settled value about ten times a second, matching the S-meter and VFO. Moving
  between a range slider's low and high handle with Tab still announces
  immediately, so the handle change is never lost behind a value update, and
  neither control does any accessibility work when no screen reader is running.

### Windows

- **The frameless window no longer drifts down the screen (#4328).** With
  **Frameless Window** enabled, AetherSDR reopened a title-bar height below
  where you left it, so a window parked at the top of the screen had to be
  nudged back up every launch — Qt was reserving room for a title bar the custom
  frame does not have. The window now reopens exactly where you left it, keeps
  its full size if you had it filling the screen, and stays put through Minimal
  Mode round trips.
- **The D-STAR waveform helper's firewall rule is provisioned (#4317).**
  AetherSDR could start and register the helper successfully while Windows
  silently blocked its inbound UDP traffic — the classic installer created no
  helper-scoped rule, and the Store/MSIX manifest's `internetClientServer`
  capability does not create a firewall exception for a medium-IL packaged
  desktop helper. The UI showed the service as running while no D-STAR data or
  audio could reach the decoder.
- **`tools/audit_colours.py` runs to completion on a legacy-code-page console
  (#4475).** It died on the `→` in the migration-target summary — after the CSV
  was written but before the summary printed, so it looked half-worked with the
  most useful part of the output exactly the part you never saw.

### macOS

- **The Intel Mac build runs on macOS 12 again, and gives up speech-to-text to
  do it (#4706, #4719).** The Intel DMG exists to serve older Intel hardware,
  and it now declares — and actually honours — a **macOS 12.0** floor. The price
  is Copy Assist: **speech-to-text no longer ships on Intel Macs.** Apple
  Silicon is untouched and keeps all three pieces — the Metal GPU backend, the
  ONNX extras and the sherpa backend — each now a hard build requirement, so a
  silent compile-out cannot ship there either.

  The two are mutually exclusive, and not by choice. macOS enforces a minimum OS
  version on *every* library inside an app bundle, not just on the app's own
  binary — so the real floor of a DMG is the highest floor of anything in it.
  The ONNX Runtime the speech features depend on is published at **macOS 15.5**,
  on both architectures, and no available build lowers it. Bundle it and the
  whole application refuses to start below 15.5, whatever the app itself claims.
  That is an OS most Intel Macs will never run — the machines this artifact is
  for are the ones that stopped at Monterey, Ventura or Sonoma. Shipping
  speech-to-text on Intel meant shipping a DMG most Intel Macs could not launch.

  Choosing reach over the feature is what took the Intel floor from 13.0 down to
  12.0. Dropping the runtime went first (#4706), leaving CPU-only transcription
  behind; that remainder is what #4719 removes. It had become its own recurring
  problem — the lower floor moved the leg onto the Metal 2.x shader tier for the
  first time, where the compiler flag turned out to be misspelled (below) and
  where nothing past that flag had ever been proven.

  Everything else in the Intel DMG is unchanged. This is also exactly the class
  of failure `assert-macos-deployment-floor.sh` now catches on every build: it
  checks every binary in the bundle against the advertised floor, which is how a
  DMG that launched fine for its maintainers and failed on the older hardware it
  was built for (#4532) stops being possible.

- **The build keeps GPU spectrum rendering when Qt comes from Qt (#4688,
  #2191).** The Apple Silicon DMG now ships the Qt it says it ships — 6.8.3, the
  same one behind every other download — and keeps drawing the spectrum on the
  GPU while doing it.

  Until now that DMG took Qt from Homebrew: whatever version Homebrew happened to
  be publishing on the day a release was tagged. That was 6.11.1 while every other
  artifact was pinned to 6.8.3, so the most-downloaded macOS build was the only one
  running a Qt nobody had tested it against — and it could change between two
  releases with no code change anywhere. It is the most likely explanation for
  #2191, where the DMG's Qt behaved differently from a standard install of the
  same version.

  Pinning it exposed a second problem that had been hiding behind Homebrew. Qt's
  own macOS packages arrange their headers differently from every other platform,
  and AetherSDR's build did not recognise that arrangement — so the GPU spectrum
  renderer quietly switched itself off and the app fell back to CPU drawing, with
  nothing in the build saying so. Both halves are fixed here, and the release now
  refuses to produce a macOS app that has silently lost GPU rendering or that
  bundles a Qt other than the pinned one.

  Also on macOS: SmartLink credential persistence — staying logged in between
  launches — is now built as part of the release rather than picked up from
  Homebrew, and its absence is a build failure instead of a feature that
  disappears without a word.

- **The Intel leg drops its hand-built Qt, and the deployment floor drops to
  macOS 12.0 (#4706).** Both macOS legs now install the same Qt 6.8.3 from
  aqtinstall, retiring an entire workflow. The hand-built Qt existed because
  *Homebrew's* bottles targeted macOS 14.0 — a diagnosis about Homebrew, not
  about Qt, and Qt's own binary was never checked.

- **The DMG builds again — five defects on the release path, each hidden behind
  the last (#4714, #4718).** The workflow that builds the macOS disk images is
  triggered by a release tag, and no per-PR check runs it, so the Qt changes
  above reached `main` never having been executed. Dispatching it by hand found
  five faults in a row; a tag would have published a release with **no macOS
  artifacts at all**, the same failure shape #4708 had just fixed for the
  aarch64 AppImage one platform over.

  *The dependency build died four seconds in.* macOS ships **bash 3.2**, where
  expanding an empty array under `set -u` is an unbound-variable error — bash
  4.4 fixed that and the runner never sees 4.4. The SIMD-flags array carried the
  identical latent crash on any architecture taking the fallback branch, and the
  qtkeychain setup script had the same trap at its own configure call — not on
  the release path, but on the local developer path its own comment declares
  supported. That call was also passing the deployment target twice.

  *Then the link failed at 100% with `library 'hidapi' not found`.* The
  package-config query returns a bare library name, so the link needs the search
  path that comes with it — and CMake propagates `PRIVATE` link *libraries* to
  the consuming executable but not `PRIVATE` link *directories*. The core
  library is static, so the link that has to resolve `-lhidapi` is the
  executable's. `portaudio` and `fftw3` carried the identical defect and are
  fixed with it; they had not failed only because their libraries happened to
  sit on a default search path, which #4706 stopped guaranteeing when it moved
  all three into a private dependency tree.

  *And the Intel leg died at 32% compiling Metal kernels (#4718)* —
  `invalid value 'metal2.4' in '-std=metal2.4'`. Metal 3 unified the platforms
  and dropped the platform prefix; Metal 2 and earlier did not, so the 2.x tier
  must be spelled `macos-metal2.4` while the 3.x tiers must not be qualified at
  all. That tier only became reachable when #4706 dropped the Intel deployment
  target to 12.0. The fix is correct and stays in the tree, but no shipping
  artifact exercises it any more: with speech-to-text dropped from the Intel
  build (#4719) that leg compiles no Metal kernels at all, and Apple Silicon is
  on the 3.x tier. It remains unvalidated end to end, and matters again the day
  something ships below the Metal 3 floor.

  With those cleared, the Apple Silicon leg is green end to end and
  `assert-macos-deployment-floor.sh` — the whole point of #4706, and never
  executed anywhere until now — reports all 37 Mach-O files in the bundle
  loading on the declared floor, with the bundled Qt matching the 6.8.3 pin,
  notarization accepted and the DMG stapled.

- **Copy Assist no longer freezes the app on first use (#4535).** Turning on ASR
  could hang the entire interface, on one Intel MacBook Pro for over 75 minutes,
  with a force-quit as the only way out. The speech-recognition engine was asking
  macOS to compile its GPU shaders the first time it looked for a graphics card,
  and on some Intel Macs Apple's shader compiler never finishes. Those shaders
  are now compiled when AetherSDR is built, so nothing is compiled on your
  machine and the panel opens immediately. Apple Silicon Macs also stop paying a
  several-second delay the first time ASR touches the GPU on each cold start.

- **A crash on the filter passband is avoided (#4525).** The widget installed
  `Qt::SizeAllCursor` as its resting cursor; on Qt 6.11 / macOS 26, entering it
  can lazily realise that shape through Cocoa's bitmap-cursor fallback and trap.

- **Copy Assist GPU discovery runs off the UI thread (#4517).** Opening the ASR
  panel no longer freezes the application or risks interrupting the radio
  connection. The panel appears immediately with the Compute control disabled
  and showing `Detecting…`; enabling ASR while discovery is still running defers
  model loading until it completes. A probe that exceeds 30 seconds logs a
  warning and falls back to CPU for the session.

### Linux & packaging

- **The AppImage runs natively on Wayland instead of XWayland (#1389, #1233).**
  On a Wayland desktop the AppImage now uses Wayland directly. Text and the
  spectrum are sharp under fractional scaling — previously the desktop was
  bitmap-scaling an X11 window — and the AppImage finally receives the fix for the
  GLX crash that could happen when opening a dialog such as Radio Setup on some
  desktops. Every other Linux build has had that fix since v0.8.12; the AppImage
  was the one left out.

  It was left out to stop a worse problem. The AppImage asked for Wayland without
  carrying the piece of Qt that talks Wayland, so it refused to start at all on
  Ubuntu 24.04 and anything else defaulting to a Wayland session. The quick fix
  was to stop asking for Wayland in the AppImage, which cured the crash and
  stranded those users on XWayland permanently. The Wayland support was in fact
  present in the Qt we build against the whole time — it simply never made it into
  the packaged app, and nothing in the build noticed, because it is loaded on
  demand rather than linked. It is now packaged, and the release build fails if it
  ever goes missing again.

  AetherSDR also now asks for Wayland *with a fallback* rather than demanding it,
  so a machine without Wayland support quietly uses XWayland instead of failing to
  start. If a desktop misbehaves under native Wayland, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`
  forces the old path — documented in the README next to `AETHER_NO_GPU`. Setting
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` yourself always wins.

  Reported by @cjdellis on Ubuntu 24.04.

- **The aarch64 (Raspberry Pi / ARM) AppImage now ships Qt 6.8.3 LTS and GPU
  spectrum rendering (#4670).** It was the only release artifact still building
  against the distro's Qt — 6.4.2, while x86_64, macOS and Windows all pinned
  6.8.3 — because Qt published no prebuilt ARM64 Linux binaries when that split
  was made. Qt has shipped them since 6.7, so the ARM build now takes the same
  recipe as everything else. The visible consequence is the renderer: 6.4.2 sat
  below the Qt 6.7 floor for `QRhiWidget`, so the ARM AppImage silently fell back
  to the CPU `QPainter` spectrum path. On 6.8.3 it renders through QRhi like
  every other platform. If a GPU or driver renders the spectrum incorrectly,
  `AETHER_NO_GPU=1` forces software OpenGL without a rebuild.

  The Qt bump raises the aarch64 AppImage's glibc floor to 2.38 (Qt's arm64
  binaries are built on Ubuntu 24.04). Raspberry Pi OS **Trixie** (glibc 2.41)
  is the supported Pi baseline; Bookworm (2.36) cannot run it — as was already
  the case for the 2.39-floored builds this replaces.

- **The aarch64 AppImage packages again, and both architectures have audio
  (#4708).** Qt builds its `linux_arm64` binaries against a newer GStreamer whose
  media backend plugin needs a library the packaging step did not install, so
  packaging died at the Qt plugin stage. The ALSA sink is installed with it.

### Build, CI & dependencies

- **Minimum Qt raised to 6.8 (#4686).** Building from source now requires Qt 6.8
  or newer. Nothing changes for users of the release binaries: the AppImage, the
  Windows installer and the macOS build were already compiled against Qt 6.8.3
  LTS, and still are.

  The old floor said 6.2 and nothing enforced it. The only CI leg near it was the
  Linux container on Ubuntu 24.04's **Qt 6.4.2** — seven minor versions behind
  current, and EOL upstream since the 6.4 series ended at 6.4.3. So the project
  was testing a Qt no artifact shipped, and *rejecting* code that is valid on
  every configuration it actually ships: PR #4646 was failed by CI for using
  `QList::assign()`, a Qt 6.6 addition that works fine on all three release
  builds. The reverse risk was live too, since no per-PR Linux job compiled
  against 6.8.3 — the AppImage first sees that Qt at release-tag time.

  The CI image now installs Qt 6.8.3 via aqtinstall instead of using the distro's
  (#4685), matching `appimage.yml` and the Windows leg, so one Qt version covers
  every check and every artifact. It also builds qtkeychain from source against
  that Qt, since the distro package is compiled against 6.4.2. A side effect: the
  CI image clears the QRhi floor (6.7+), so GPU spectrum rendering is no longer
  silently compiled out of Linux CI builds.

  Distro Qt satisfies 6.8 on Debian Trixie, Ubuntu 25.10+, Fedora 41+ and Arch.
  On **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** it does not — build against a Qt from aqtinstall or the
  Qt online installer and pass
  `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.8.3/gcc_64`. See the README's dependency
  section. The Qt 6.5 compatibility fallbacks the old floor kept alive are
  removed (#4691).

- **The Windows Qt is pinned exactly, and GPU spectrum is asserted on every
  artifact (#4688).** The Windows installer asked for `6.8.*` while CI pinned
  `6.8.3`; they agreed only because Qt stopped publishing open-source 6.8.x
  binaries after 6.8.3 — a licensing accident, not a pin. `AETHER_GPU_SPECTRUM`
  is a request that CMake can silently flip back off, and the guard that catches
  that existed on one artifact of three. It now runs on all of them.
- **Every HTTP client has a transfer timeout (#4688).** Most did not, so a
  half-open TCP connection left the request pending forever with no `finished()`,
  no error and no user-visible failure — space-weather panels, POTA spots, PSK
  Reporter, SmartLink auth, the About dialog's contributor list, the version
  check, the credits panel and OSM map tiles simply never updated, and the large
  downloads (ASR models, NVIDIA AFX packs, firmware) sat at a dead progress bar
  with no way to tell "slow" from "gone".
- **CI image publishing is restored (#4683).** It had not published since
  2026-05-04: the build completed and the *push* was denied, because the package
  lived in a personal namespace the repo-scoped token has no write access to.
- **Per-PR runner cost cut from ~130 minutes to ~35 (#4655).** Three of the six
  causes were defects rather than tuning opportunities — including a malformed
  `cl.exe` flag that had silently disabled the compiler cache on a *required*
  check since April. No source changes. The system-libraries canary's ccache cap
  was raised after its first real run saturated it (#4659).
- **Optional system `libwhisper` (#4516).** Distribution packagers can build
  against a system whisper library instead of the vendored one.
- Dependency bumps: `actions/setup-node` 4.4.0 → 7.0.0 (#4664),
  `docker/login-action` 4.5.1 → 4.6.0 (#4663), `mozilla-actions/sccache-action`
  0.0.10 → 0.0.11 (#4662).

### Tests

- `radio_capability_gating_test` no longer fails intermittently on assertions
  unrelated to whatever is under review — its wait loop passed a millisecond
  argument that is a *maximum, not a wait*, so it spun on an empty queue instead
  of waiting for the cross-thread relay (#4693, #4697). The corrected wait is
  hoisted into one shared helper, with the trap itself pinned as a test (#4699).
- `cross_needle_meter_test` asserts design contracts rather than coincidences,
  and CI actually runs it — two of its assertions failed on a clean `main`, and
  nothing executed the target that would have caught them (#4559).
- The ConnectionPanel growth proof is deterministic instead of relying on font
  scaling as a proxy for "the body needs more height", which is not portable
  (#4679); the Connect-to-Radio VPN advanced section is covered by the panel size
  test (#4643).
- `local_memory_bank_test` had been failing deterministically on Windows since
  #4590 — an open read handle, not the re-baselining logic it appeared to be
  (#4625).
- The logging category-toggle Info enablement is regression-guarded end to end
  (#4419).

### Documentation

- **`CHANGELOG.md` is release-prep only (#4707).** An ordinary PR must not add
  an entry — every entry is prepended to the top of the same list, so any two
  PRs that both add one conflict with each other. The section is written at
  release prep from the merged PR bodies. `AGENTS.md` also now spells out all
  **five** places the version is stated, after v26.7.4.1 shipped with three of
  them stale (#4519).
- **The project canon is aligned with the shipped RFC #4603 architecture
  (#4624).** The Radio-Authoritative Settings Policy was stated family-blind —
  correct doctrine for Flex, and exactly what the client now does *not* do for
  the HL2, so an agent following it literally would have flagged shipped
  behaviour as a violation. It is rewritten capability-shaped.
- **The README no longer promises a runtime GPU fallback that does not exist
  (#4705).** `AETHER_GPU_SPECTRUM` selects the spectrum widget's base class at
  compile time; the CPU `QPainter` path is a build-time alternative, not
  something that catches a machine whose GPU initialisation fails.

## [v26.7.4.1] — 2026-07-27

### Hotfix: TCI rig control restored for WSJT-X and control surfaces

One fix on top of v26.7.4, no other changes.

- **fix(tci): confirm the frequency a `vfo:` SET actually reached (#4500,
  #4493)** — v26.7.4 lost all WSJT-X rig control over TCI. Band changes
  failed, the reported dial frequency was wrong, and transmissions could go
  out of band.

  The v26.7.4 TCI refactor replaced the model-driven tune with a raw
  `slice tune` written straight at the connection, then read the frequency
  back out of `SliceModel` when the radio's command reply arrived. The raw
  command bypasses `SliceModel`, so nothing updated the model — and the radio
  does not answer `slice tune` with an `RF_frequency` status either. The
  read-back could only ever observe the **pre-tune** value, so every `vfo:`
  confirmation echoed the frequency the slice had already left.

  WSJT-X's `do_frequency()` waits on that echo: it concluded the radio had not
  moved and reported rig-control failure on every band change, while the radio
  was in fact on the new band. Any client accumulating a relative change — a
  Stream Deck tuning encoder, a band stepper — had its position reset by the
  stale echo and oscillated around one frequency instead of walking.

  A second short-circuit added in the same refactor confirmed from the model
  *without commanding the radio* when the request matched what the model held.
  Once model and radio had diverged, that silently dropped real tunes and
  falsely acknowledged them.

  Tuning now goes through `SliceModel::setFrequency()` / `tuneAndRecenter()`
  again on every command plane. The setter *is* the command path — it emits
  the byte-identical `slice tune` and additionally updates the model, honours a
  locked slice, and routes through the TX-inhibit guard the raw command
  bypassed. Confirmations now carry the frequency the radio actually reached.

## [v26.7.4] — 2026-07-26

### Demo mode · on-device speech-to-text · experimental Hermes-Lite 2

94 commits since v26.7.3. The headline addition is **demo mode**: a synthetic `SimBackend` on the aetherd `IRadioBackend` seam that generates its own RX audio and matching panadapter, so AetherSDR can be demonstrated, developed against, and regression-tested with no hardware attached. **Experimental Hermes-Lite 2 support** lands on the same seam — receive, transmit, TCI signaling for WSJT-X, an operator-controllable panadapter span, and per-radio nicknames. HL2 is an early, experimental backend and is **not** a supported radio family yet; FlexRadio remains the supported target.

Alongside those, **Copy Assist** brings on-device speech-to-text via whisper.cpp with a transcription-language selector, **AetherClock** decodes NIST time signals into an alignment display, and a new **GPS and station-location dashboard** surfaces position and timing. The 3D stacked-trace spectrum gets its largest polish pass yet — surface-mapped slice shadows, preserved history across scroll boundaries, and a series of edge-artifact and motion-smoothness fixes across both Flex and KiwiSDR sources.

The automation bridge gains an observe-only mode, phaseful pointer gestures, subsystem memory telemetry, and a secured fresh-build MCP auth handoff. TCI broadcasts considerably more model state. Peripheral support adds ACOM S-series amplifiers.

### Hermes-Lite 2 & the aetherd backend seam (experimental)

> Hermes-Lite 2 is an **experimental** backend in this release, not a supported
> radio family. FlexRadio remains the supported target.

- Add Hermes-Lite 2 receive support via the aetherd `IRadioBackend` seam — the first non-Flex backend. (#4448 — @ten9876)
- Add Hermes-Lite 2 transmit. (#4466 — @ten9876)
- Add basic TCI signaling for HL2, enough to run WSJT-X over a Hermes-Lite 2. (#4471 — @jensenpat)
- Make the HL2 panadapter span operator-controllable, with a 6 Mb low-bandwidth mode. (#4470 — @jensenpat)
- Add a user-assignable per-radio nickname for HL2, keyed by MAC. (#4468 — @nigelfenton)
- Vendor WDSP 2.00 into `libaethercore` for Hermes-Lite receive. (#4278 — @jensenpat)

### Demo mode

- Add a built-in demo mode: `SimBackend` behind the `IRadioBackend` seam synthesizes RX audio and a matching panadapter render, with a fault-injection harness for exercising error paths. It only ever synthesizes receive audio — it cannot key (Principle VI). (#4473 — @nigelfenton)
- Gate the demo's direct seam-audio connect so it no longer double-feeds Hermes-Lite 2 receive. The connect added for the demo was unconditional, so any backend that demodulates in-process — HL2 included — delivered every frame twice. (#4490 — @jensenpat)

### Speech-to-text — Copy Assist

- Add on-device speech-to-text "Copy Assist" via whisper.cpp. (#4338 — @ten9876)
- Add a Copy Assist transcription-language selector. (#4399 — @K5PTB)
- Nest Copy Assist settings under a single configuration key (Principle V). (#4420 — @ten9876)
- Move Copy Assist off the lossy visualization tap. It subscribed to `rxPostChainScopeReady`, an 8 ms-throttled *visualization* signal that discards whole blocks rather than skipping a repaint — with NR2 on, blocks arrive 5.33 ms apart and roughly half the speech samples were dropped, then spliced into a stream with a discontinuity at every join. Now driven from the unconditional, source-tagged presentation signal, which also stops a Kiwi running alongside a Flex from interleaving two receivers into one transcript. (#4486 via #4488 — @ten9876)
- Fix frameless window support in Copy Assist Settings. (#4417 — @rfoust)

### Time & location

- Add an AetherClock NIST time-signal decode engine. (#4336 — @Ozy311)
- Add the AetherClock applet and alignment display. (#4337 — @Ozy311)
- Add a GPS and station-location dashboard. (#4290 — @jensenpat)
- Restore the GPS status label layout. (#4431 — @jensenpat)

### Spectrum, waterfall & 3D FFT

- Add surface-mapped slice shadows to the 3D FFT. (#4439 — @rfoust)
- Add cached elevation shadows to slice flags. (#4442 — @rfoust)
- Preserve 3D FFT history and stabilize smooth-scroll boundaries. (#4432 — @rfoust)
- Smooth waterfall and 3D FFT motion for both Flex and KiwiSDR sources. (#4425 — @rfoust)
- Smooth window resize and panadapter navigation with GPU previews. (#4303 — @rfoust)
- Stabilize the 3D FFT rear edge during delayed row arrivals. (#4476 — @rfoust)
- Resynchronize the 3D FFT floor after a bandwidth zoom. (#4477 — @rfoust)
- Fix flat 3D FFT traces after dBm scale changes. (#4279 — @rfoust)
- Fix the wide 3D stacked-trace right-edge artifact. (#4371 — @rfoust)
- Fix the DC-edge 3D comb and a stalled waterfall. (#4413 — @rfoust)
- Add an independent FFT trace line color, separate from the fill. (#4239 via #4312 — @aethersdr-agent)
- Preserve panadapter Center Lock across band changes. (#4327 — @rfoust)
- Unify the waterfall pane height split. (#4322 — @nigelfenton)
- Make multi-pan pop-out uploads safe. (#4329 — @rfoust)
- Contain panadapter overlay wheel events. (#4463 — @rfoust)

### Slices & tuning

- Add Slice Link: right-click a panadapter to link two slices so tuning either retunes the other — across panadapters, including Kiwi-sourced slices. Propagation rides the shared tuning policy (lock/SWR guards, reveal/pan-follow), suspends while a member is VFO-locked, and shows a ⇄ marker on both linked slices. Bridge: `slice link <a> <b> on|off` and a `linkedTo` slice-snapshot field. (#4326 — @quelleck)
- Treat a diversity slice as not a split partner. (#4374 — @nigelfenton)
- Accept conventional band-name aliases (`70cm` → `440`) in declared bands. (#4259 — @nigelfenton)

### Audio & DSP

- Improve NR2 suppression quality and settings reliability. (#4400 — @rfoust)
- Preserve the global AetherDSP selection across mode changes. (#4418 — @rfoust)
- Preserve Kiwi diversity slice volume across an antenna change. (#4302 — @wa2n-code)
- Fix KiwiSDR mute poisoning FLEX band-stack recall. (#4375 — @rfoust)
- Make the KiwiSDR status overlay dismissible. (#4446 — @rfoust)
- Name Kiwi waterfall controls for assistive tools. (#4373 — @rfoust)

### Automation bridge & MCP

- Add an operator-controlled observe-only bridge mode. (#4188 via #4208 — @ten9876)
- Add phaseful pointer gestures. (#4355 — @rfoust)
- Add an optional slice id to the bridge `tune` verb (`tune <mhz> [sliceId]`, JSON `id` field) so scripts can drive a non-active slice directly instead of the racy `slice select` → `tune` → re-select flap. No id keeps today's active-slice behavior; lock, SWR-sweep, and Multi-Flex ownership refusals apply to both forms. (#4325 — @quelleck)
- Add cross-platform subsystem memory telemetry to the bridge. (#4293 — @jensenpat)
- Secure the fresh-build MCP auth handoff. (#4356 — @rfoust)
- Remove the `AETHER_AUTOMATION_NO_AUTOCONNECT` env gate, with the original behavior restored in follow-up. (#4401, #4421 — @jensenpat, @rfoust)
- Memoize SWR guide samples to end an `AETHER_AUTOMATION` GUI freeze. (#4376 — @Ozy311)
- Pre-fill issue reports with a redacted log tail. (#4314 — @aethersdr-agent)

### TCI

- Broadcast which slice has GUI focus. (#4160 via #4323 — @milenjb)
- Broadcast DSP, squelch, RIT/XIT and TX power on model change. (#4430 — @milenjb)
- Serialize split routing and power replies. (#4407 — @jensenpat)

### Spotting

- Add a column-visibility menu and shrinkable width to SpotHub. (#4157 via #4280 — @M7HNF-Ian)
- Add a one-shot WSPR beacon transmitter to PSK Reporter. (#4435 — @jensenpat)
- Give operator feedback when Add Spot forwards to DX Cluster. (#2857 via #4294 — @aethersdr-agent)

### Controllers & peripherals

- Add ACOM S-series amplifier support over serial / ser2net. (#4298 — @NF0T)
- Self-heal a stale relative-CC encoding lock on a controller knob-mode change. (#4318 — @skerker)
- Fix center-64 MIDI VFO tuning jumps (CTR2-Midi). (#4271 — @jensenpat)
- Fix the AetherControl Compact mode trap on short displays. (#4365 — @jensenpat)
- Guard the amp-handle cache against a mis-routed tuner handle. (#4203 via #4313 — @aethersdr-agent)

### Operator workflow

- Add an animated community credits experience. (#4250 — @jensenpat)
- Add import and export backups for keyboard shortcuts. (#4226 — @jensenpat)
- Name the target and report the result on Profile Manager Save. (#4396, #4362 via #4464 — @Ozy311)
- Fix deferred pan writes during profile loads. (#4224 — @Ozy311)
- Reset stale per-connection state (radio-name label, DAX-TX stream) on reconnect. (#4260 — @nigelfenton)
- Persist container dock transitions to disk immediately. (#4427 via #4428 — @aethersdr-agent)
- Keep TX power sliders stable during a drag. (#4351 — @rfoust)
- Gate the status-bar TX timer during tune carriers. (#4422 — @jensenpat)
- Gate the DAX nudge as a per-stream one-shot. (#1439 via #4384 — @aethersdr-agent)
- Allow a compact floating PWR meter. (#4315 — @rfoust)
- Honor frameless mode for radio M-message dialogs. (#4370 — @rfoust)
- Route the UI Scale restart prompt through `FramelessMessageBox`. (#4392 — @rfoust)
- Reflect toggle state in labels. (#4389 — @K5PTB)
- Organize and stabilize the network diagnostics tooltip. (#4393 — @rfoust)
- Restore Display panel tooltip frames. (#4440 — @rfoust)
- Fix stale CW and RTTY panels after pan routing. (#4410 — @rfoust)

### macOS

- Fix native Metal backing-store growth. (#4352 — @rfoust)
- Fail cleanly without GUI services. (#4238 — @rfoust)
- Fix waveform resize geometry. (#4386 — @rfoust)

### Packaging, build & documentation

- Check that system libraries build in CI/CD. (#4256 — @dawkagaming)
- Propagate the system RtMidi dependency. (#4255 — @dawkagaming)
- Install ThumbDV udev rules only with DVStar. (#4254 — @dawkagaming)
- Clean compiler and linker warnings. (#4369 — @rfoust)
- Auto-cancel superseded workflow runs via concurrency groups. (#4346 — @ten9876)
- Read the log back in Text mode so `async_log_writer_test` passes on Windows. (#4321 — @nigelfenton)
- Fix Windows local build prerequisites — the `QT_ROOT_DIR` step and a PowerShell 5.1 parse failure. (#4378 — @Ozy311)
- Move `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` from CODEOWNERS Tier 1 to Tier 2. (#4465 — @ten9876)
- Add a first-contribution cheat sheet for the video tutorial. (#4469 — @ten9876)
- Add a cheat sheet covering model, effort and context as usage levers. (#4479 — @ten9876)
- Bump `docker/login-action` 4.4.0 → 4.5.1, `microsoft/microsoft-store-apppublisher` 1.3 → 1.4, `actions/checkout` 7.0.0 → 7.0.1, and `actions/setup-python` 6.3.0 → 7.0.0. (#4450, #4451, #4452, #4453 — @dependabot)

## [v26.7.3] — 2026-07-19

### Cross-needle metering · radio-state fidelity · operating polish

25 commits since v26.7.2. The headline addition is a new **cross-needle PWR / SWR applet**, joined by configurable analog S-meter themes and more accurate SWR response. This release also tightens radio-authoritative panadapter, KiwiSDR, D-STAR, and CWX behavior; fixes a Linux PC Audio stall after TCI transmit; and rounds out the operating experience across the VFO, memory drawer, compact-screen radio picker, Aetherial Audio, and update dialogs.

Agent automation and release infrastructure get a smaller but useful pass as well: canonical bridge identity in the status chip, optional MCP screenshot output paths, stronger macOS helper signing and bundle placement, a much faster cached Intel Qt build, refreshed documentation, and a release-action dependency bump.

### Metering

- Make CWX availability follow the active TX slice. (#4269 — @jensenpat)

### Operator workflow

- Show active noise reduction in the VFO DSP label. (#4241 — @jensenpat)
- Reconcile the SPLIT / SWAP badge from the slice's current role on every update. (#4262 — @Ozy311)
- Keep the RX applet frequency font scoped correctly after restart. (#4267 — @jensenpat)
- Keep **Add Memory** visible in short memory drawers. (#4272 — @jensenpat)
- Keep the local-radio list scrollable and reachable on compact displays. (#4284 — @nigelfenton)
- Fix frameless edge resizing in Aetherial Audio. (#4266 — @jensenpat)
- Reserve title-bar margin so update-dialog text is not clipped. (#4245 — @aethersdr-agent)

### Audio, diagnostics & automation

- Fix the Linux PC Audio capture stall after a TCI transmit handoff. (#4251 — @jensenpat)
- Add opt-in TX capture health summaries for diagnosing TCI handoffs. (#4233 — @jensenpat)
- Use the canonical automation agent identity in the status chip and accessibility metadata. (#4283 — @rfoust)
- Add an optional output path to MCP `grab_widget`. (#4270 — @skerker)

### Packaging, build & documentation

- Sign additional `Contents/MacOS` helpers, including `aether-dv-waveform`, before notarization. (#4213 — @ten9876)
- Put `AetherDV.cfg` in `Contents/Resources` instead of `Contents/MacOS`. (#4218 — @ten9876)
- Cache the Intel from-source Qt build, reducing the path from roughly 2.5 hours to about 20 minutes. (#4217 — @ten9876)
- Refresh the README and current 3D stacked-trace showcase image. (#4244 plus follow-up asset — @ten9876)
- Note the optional `setup-deepfilter.sh` prerequisite for local DFNR builds. (#4282 — @ten9876)
- Bump `softprops/action-gh-release` from 3.0.1 to 3.0.2. (#4285 — @dependabot)

## [v26.7.2] — 2026-07-12

### aetherd radio-backend seam · MCP server for AI agents · BNR on RTX 50-series · searchable Radio Setup · KiwiSDR passwords · D-STAR ThumbDV

123 commits since v26.7.1. The headline work is the **aetherd `IRadioBackend`
seam** — a large architectural refactor that moves all Flex wire objects,
threads, and status/command decoding behind a typed backend so a second radio
family can be added without touching the GUI — landing alongside a new
**Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that lets an AI assistant drive
AetherSDR through schema-validated tools. Rounding out the release: **BNR now
runs on RTX 50-series / Blackwell GPUs**, **per-receiver KiwiSDR passwords**
plus several KiwiSDR memory/connection fixes, **searchable Radio Setup and
Network Diagnostics browsers**, **local D-STAR via a ThumbDV**, an **adaptive
ESSB RX filter**, **WAVE showcase visualizations**, and a broad wave of VFO,
spectrum, USB-cable, and controller fixes.

### Added

- **Per-receiver KiwiSDR passwords.** Each configured KiwiSDR receiver now
  takes its own optional password, stored in the OS credential store (with a
  clearly-reported session-only fallback when no keychain is available). Radio
  Setup's KiwiSDR section is reorganized into configured-receiver and
  add-receiver areas; you change a password by typing over the masked value, no
  old-password entry required. (#4207)
- **BNR on RTX 50-series / Blackwell GPUs.** The NVIDIA AFX denoiser now ships
  `sm_100`/`sm_120` packs for Windows and Linux, so RTX 50-series owners (e.g.
  RTX 5060 Ti) get a working Download instead of a dead button. GPUs with no
  published pack are handled gracefully — BNR disables itself and steers you to
  DFNR rather than erroring. (#4206, #3972)
- **MCP server for AI-assistant control.** A new Model Context Protocol server
  exposes the automation bridge to AI agents, guarded by a Radio Setup toggle
  and token auth. 13 common bridge verbs (tune, slice, pan, connect, record,
  mark, menu, floors, streams, capture_audio, and more) are promoted to
  first-class, schema-validated MCP tools, and the server adds robustness
  helpers (`wait_for`, `assert_state`, fuzzy `did_you_mean` target resolution),
  a guided `validate_ui_change` prompt, and read-only live-state resources.
  TX keying stays behind the existing `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX` gate. See
  [`docs/automation-bridge.md`](docs/automation-bridge.md). (#4177, #4189, #4197)
- **Local D-STAR via a ThumbDV.** A bundled `aether-dv-waveform` helper adds
  complete local D-STAR using a connected ThumbDV/DV3000U hardware vocoder —
  RX/TX audio, headers, callsigns, repeater routing, and 20-character messages.
  The Waveforms window handles ThumbDV discovery and lifecycle, AetherModem
  gains a D-STAR station/routing page, and Network Diagnostics gains
  digital-voice delivery metrics. Cross-platform serial; no proprietary FTDI
  binaries shipped. Software AMBE is intentionally not included. (#4186)
- **Radio-declared band capability.** A radio can now advertise which bands it
  supports via an optional `bands=` discovery/status key, so the band UI reflects
  what the connected hardware (or a transverter setup) actually offers. (#4027,
  #4194)
- **Searchable Radio Setup browser.** Radio Setup is reorganized from a flat tab
  row into a categorized, symptom-searchable settings browser with a single
  content pane, larger navigation targets, keyboard Find, and screen-reader
  metadata. (#4164)
- **Searchable Network Diagnostics browser.** Network Diagnostics is likewise
  refactored into a task-oriented troubleshooting browser grouped under Status /
  Trends / Support, searchable by symptom (jitter, underrun, UDP, packet gaps,
  bitrate, WSJT-X). (#4165)
- **Microwave weak-signal bands.** Adds the 13cm / 9cm / 5cm / 3cm microwave
  bands. (#4149)
- **Stream Deck+ Encoder dials.** Three rotary-dial actions for the bundled
  Elgato plugin — VFO tuning, RF power, and volume — each with press-to-cycle
  behavior. (#4162)
- **Operator transmit timer in the status bar.** A bright-green elapsed-time
  readout appears beside PC Audio during operator-driven transmits (MOX, PTT,
  footswitch, VOX, CW, tune) and stays hidden for TCI/DAX (external-app)
  transmits. (#4131)
- **CHIRP-next CSV import.** Memory Import now auto-detects and reads CHIRP-next
  generic CSV exports in addition to AetherSDR's own SmartSDR-format CSV, so
  operators can bring channel lists across from other radios. (#4129)
- **Per-pan Center Lock.** Replaces the old title-bar Pan Lock with a per-panadapter
  Center Lock in the right-click menu that targets a chosen slice, works
  independently across multiple pans, and is reachable from keyboard, MIDI,
  FlexControl, and RC-28. (#4116)
- **Help menu revamp.** Reset Settings and File an Issue are promoted out of the
  Support dialog to top-level Help items, with new Website/donation links and a
  reordered menu; Help windows also gain frameless support. (#4108, #4190)
- **TCI CW Skimmer support.** Extends TCI to feed SDC / CW Skimmer, keeping the
  skimmer DDS aligned with the panadapter center. (#3913, #4172)
- **USB cable configuration.** Adds a Cable Type selector (CAT/Bit/BCD/LDPA/Passthrough)
  to every cable page plus a new LDPA page and an Unconfigured page for freshly
  plugged, untyped cables; the Bit cable page gains its full master-detail field
  set (PTT-dependent, PTT/TX delay, frequency-range, antenna/slice sourcing). (#4038, #4033)
- **QRZ callsign lookup.** A CW-decoder contact card and lookup dialog resolve
  callsigns via QRZ with a 7-day cache. (#3990)
- **WAVE showcase visualizations.** Three GPU-only, theme-colored, audio-reactive
  scenes — 3D Ridge, Tunnel, and Horizon — for the WAVE scope, with an ambient
  attract mode when no audio is flowing, riding on a rewritten incremental +
  QRhi GPU scope render path. (#3991, #3955)
- **Adaptive RX filter for SSB (ESSB auto-fit).** The RX passband can
  automatically fit the received signal width for ESSB. (#3945)
- **Kiwi/Flex display toggle.** A bottom-left toggle switches a KiwiSDR-connected
  pan's spectrum/waterfall between the Kiwi and Flex sources while audio and
  meters keep their behavior; Kiwi display keeps TX inhibited. (#4081)
- **Extended Passband overlay.** A new panadapter context-menu option extends the
  slice passband fill down through the waterfall. (#4137)
- **Wider CW filter presets** for the CW filter picker.
- **°C/°F toggle and live numeric overlays** on the MTR applet. (#3974)
- **Panadapter overlay message stack** for surfacing transient status text over
  the spectrum. (#3999)
- **Automation-bridge additions** for UI testing: `layout` / `scale` / `get rhi`
  verbs (#4121), a `clickAt` verb (#4100), `rightClick` for context menus (#4137),
  and a `get clients` verb with stale-session eviction (#3981).

### Changed

- **aetherd radio-backend architecture (RFC).** A multi-PR refactor introduces
  the `IRadioBackend` seam and a `RadioCapabilities` model, a `FlexBackend` that
  now owns the wire objects (RadioConnection / PanadapterStream) and their
  threads, and typed model conversions that move all Flex status/command decode
  behind the seam — Panadapter, Slice, Meter, Transmit, plus the amp (PGXL) and
  tuner (TGXL) accessories. Supporting work extracts `libaethercore` and an
  `IConnectionAutomation` seam, freezes above-seam vendor coupling with an
  include ratchet, and reclassifies peripheral/accessory devices out of the
  radio-vendor set. Purely internal; no user-facing behavior change. (#4047,
  #4054, #4056, #4058, #4063, #4065, #4066, #4068, #4071, #4075, #4077, #4079,
  #4087, #4089, #4093, #4099, #4101, #4113, #4192, #4200)
- **Hermes-Lite 2 groundwork.** A raw-IQ data-plane spike and design note stand
  up the first non-Flex radio family on the new backend seam (no user-facing HL2
  support yet). (#4171)
- **Bridge internals.** The automation bridge moves to a table-driven verb
  registry, and a new `gen_bridge_docs` CI check fails on verb-documentation
  drift. (#4175, #4180)
- **liquid-dsp is disabled in default builds on every platform.** The vendored
  toolkit remains available to opt-in builds with `-DENABLE_LIQUID_DSP=ON`, but
  no AetherSDR module currently consumes it. (#4146, #4176)
- **WAVE applet defaults to 25 fps** (was 60), matching the panadapter's default
  FFT cadence, and the GPU device selector moves to the top of the Display
  panel's SYSTEM group. A previously saved refresh rate is kept; the slider still
  reaches 60. (#4106)
- **Smoother panadapter repaints.** Repaint scheduling is coalesced to cut
  redundant frames. (#4139)
- **Sharper KiwiSDR waterfall.** Improved clarity and auto-scaling, and the 3D
  stacked-trace scrollback now stays synced with the waterfall history on Kiwi
  receivers. (#4069, #4083)
- **Compiler-warnings cleanup.** A multi-phase sweep clears GCC `-Wall`/`-Wextra`
  and MSVC `/W3` diagnostics, migrates deprecated Qt APIs, and fixes C++20
  implicit-`this` captures across the tree. (#4046, #4052, #4059, #4060, #4061, #4062)
- **Project/CI housekeeping.** Aether-gate is surfaced and auto-mirrored under the
  org (#4193); a FUNDING.yml Sponsor button is added (#4088); CODEOWNERS is
  retiered with sensitive workflows carved to Tier 1 (#4080); Windows CI
  hard-gates the PDB regression class (#4117); dialog-size regression tests are
  registered with ctest (#4021); and dependencies bump — ws 8.20.1→8.21.0
  (CVE-2026-48779), docker/login-action, docker/build-push-action (#4169, #4023,
  #4022). Positioning docs are reframed from Linux-native to cross-platform-equal
  (#3966), and FreeDV/SpotHub checkboxes migrate to ThemeManager tokens (#4015).

### Fixed

- **KiwiSDR waterfall-history leak.** Releasing a receiver (switch-away,
  slice-clear, disconnect, profile removal) now frees its cached waterfall
  history instead of accumulating ~170 MB per distinct receiver for the life of
  the session. (#4202)
- **KiwiSDR connection released when a slice stops using it**, instead of being
  held open indefinitely. (#3971)
- **Preserve RX DSP stereo balance.** Client-side RX DSP (NR2/RN2/NR4/MNR/DFNR/BNR)
  no longer collapses the Flex remote-audio stream to mono; left/right balance is
  kept through the denoisers, and Kiwi/diversity paths keep independent DSP state
  per source. (#4135)
- **Adaptive RX filter QSO-swap regression.** Removes the re-engage restore that
  could reapply one operator's fit to another operator on the same dial
  frequency, plus accuracy fixes and an opt-in edge-heterodyne mode. (#4050)
- **Duplicate multiflex client eviction.** A second AetherSDR client sharing an
  identity is no longer wrongly evicted as a duplicate. (#4179)
- **CWX robustness.** Inline speed modifiers are hardened, and queue-drain is now
  detected via the reply's radio index instead of the broken `cwx queue=` field.
  (#4187, #3979)
- **Panadapter wire-parse guard.** `wide`/`loopa`/`loopb`/`weighted_average`
  status fields are parsed defensively. (#4148)
- **Spectrum fixes.** FFT average vs. weighted-average is reconciled (#4126);
  frequency now maps across the full content canvas so a band change clears the
  tape and Pan-Follows-VFO is symmetric, with tighter margins and opaque scale
  strips (#4107); the 2D FFT trace is restored to crisp segment-clamped strokes
  (#3975); and FFT edge smoothing during pan/zoom is fixed (#3984).
- **VFO/slice UI.** Windows cursor and hover feedback is made consistent across
  every VFO field (#4134); VFO flags are correct after a multi-pan restart
  (#4124); the RX slice tooltip label mismatch is fixed (#4122); and the FDVL
  passband is mirrored to the lower side of the carrier (#4104).
- **Display/panel fixes.** The DFNR selector is disabled when DeepFilterNet isn't
  built (#4136); the status-bar station label is stabilized (#4138); Band Zoom /
  Segment Zoom send the panadapter command rather than a slice set (#4102);
  side-panel tiles pin to their size hint so sparse layouts don't gap (#4100);
  Windows shows a note-only DAX applet instead of inert controls (#4114); the
  PROF applet and Profiles menu reflect the radio's active global profile
  (#4111); and the Display overlay panel scrolls when the window is short (#3989).
- **Crash fixes.** The add-second-panadapter swapchain crash on Intel D3D11 GPUs
  is fixed (#4120), and the QsoRecorder slice reference is guarded against
  use-after-free (#4004).
- **QRZ.** Login (broken end-to-end since #3990) is repaired and the password is
  usable without keychain persistence. (#4043, #4044)
- **DAX RX stream ownership** is centralized in PanadapterStream, killing the
  re-assert storm class. (#4017)
- **USB Cables** no longer shares serial settings across cables. (#4030)
- **APRS/GPS.** The GPSDO lat/lon format is parsed so AetherModem uses the
  6000-series GPS fix (#3995), and GPS-grid conveniences are enabled from live GPS
  status rather than the model name (#3997).
- **Controllers.** The RC-28 TX LED tracks the interlock transmit state rather
  than MOX (#3978), and the RC-28 accumulator resyncs when a slice is already on
  the 1 kHz grid (#3973).
- **Misc.** Radio Settings checkboxes are visible in dark mode (#4012); cleared
  keyboard bindings no longer revert to default on restart (#3964);
  `AETHER_NO_GPU` selects the OpenGL backend on Windows (#3987); KiwiSDR waterfall
  rows stay sharp (#3985); "band not available" feedback returns when net-tuning
  an unconfigured transverter band (#3992); ownership-gated auto-floor gains
  stale-session detection and eviction (#3981); the Stream Deck plugin's TCI port
  default is corrected (40001→50001) with added connection diagnostics (#4167);
  Radio Setup search stays lazy with a clamped header keyboard skip (#4195); and
  Network Diagnostics category headers dim with edge-guarded arrow navigation
  (#4185).

### Removed

- **Lean Mode.** The global low-overhead render toggle (#3283) is gone; the app
  always renders at full quality. If you had Lean Mode on: the WAVE scope
  reappears on upgrade (Lean hid it without turning its sidebar tile off — close
  the tile if you don't want it), VFO panels return to translucent rendering, and
  meters repaint at their full animation rate. The structural fixes tracked in
  #3283 (GPU-side scope/meter rendering) are the intended replacement for Lean's
  mitigations. `get panstats` no longer reports the `leanMode` field. (#4106)

## [v26.7.1] — 2026-07-02

### 3D stacked-trace spectrum + in-process NVIDIA BNR + TX meter readouts + 60 fps panadapters

29 commits since v26.6.5. Headlined by a new **3D stacked-trace spectrum**
panadapter render mode, the **NVIDIA in-process AI noise removal** engine (BNR,
no container), **mouse-over numeric readouts** on the TX meters, and a **60 fps
GPU panadapter** rendering path — plus platform-based model capability gating
from FlexLib and a broad wave of audio, spectrum, and UI fixes.

### Added

- **3D stacked-trace spectrum panadapter.** A new **Spectrum: 2D / 3D** display
  mode turns the spectrum region into a perspective stacked-trace surface — a
  rolling history of FFT traces receding into the distance — with the waterfall,
  scales, and all overlays (spots, memories, markers, band plan) still rendering
  underneath. Ridge height is anchored to the measured noise floor with a
  floor→peak colour gradient, single-frame impulse bursts are rejected, and a
  **3D Floor** depth slider tunes how far below the floor to surface.
  Cross-platform (macOS / Windows / Linux) with graceful GPU→CPU degradation. (#3899)
- **dBm / noise-floor scale in 3D mode.** The right-edge amplitude scale returns
  in 3D stacked-trace mode as a full-height linear axis that reads just like the
  2D scale, synced to and persisted with the **3D Floor** slider. (#3937)
- **BNR — NVIDIA GPU AI noise removal, in-process, no container.** The AetherDSP
  **BNR** module runs the NVIDIA Maxine **Audio Effects (AFX)** denoiser directly
  inside AetherSDR on your local NVIDIA RTX/GeForce GPU (Turing+) — lowest
  latency, no Docker, no microservice to manage. Supported on **Linux and
  Windows** (`-DENABLE_NVIDIA_AFX=ON`); macOS / non-NVIDIA machines use DFNR. An
  intensity slider, status, and a one-time **Download** for the AFX runtime live
  in the panel below the button row. See [`docs/nvidia-bnr.md`](docs/nvidia-bnr.md). (#3902)
- **AFX download-on-demand (`NvidiaAfxPack`).** BNR fetches its ~2 GB GPU runtime
  on first use and caches it, so the shipped app carries none of it. On Linux the
  CUDA libs come from NVIDIA's PyPI wheels (pinned, sha256-verified) and the
  AFX/TensorRT/model bits from a small sha-pinned release asset; on Windows the
  whole runtime ships as one self-contained sha-pinned `.zip`. (#3902)
- **Mouse-over numeric readouts on the TX meters.** Hover any TX meter — SWR,
  forward power, ALC, mic Level, or Compression — and a floating badge shows the
  exact value (e.g. `12 W`, `1.12 : 1`, `-6.4 dBFS`) instead of making you
  eyeball the bar. Updates live while hovered and fades a second after you
  leave. (#3936)
- **SWR sweep — optional manual range.** A **Limit range** checkbox with
  **From** / **To** fields confines a sweep to a licence sub-band or a slice of
  interest instead of always sweeping the whole band. Off by default; the fields
  seed with the current band's edges, and the bounds can only ever narrow the
  sweep — never widen it past what the regional band plan permits. (#3885)
- **Local CW/CWX sidetone captured in Client-Side recordings.** QSO recordings
  now carry the AetherSDR-generated CW sidetone alongside voice, so a single
  continuous file holds both across SSB↔CW switches — usable at last for contest
  CW review. Client-Side recording is now the out-of-box default (Radio Side
  stays selectable). Scope is AetherSDR-keyed CW (keyboard / paddle / CWX). (#3895)
- **KiwiSDR protocol metadata scaffolding.** Richer read-only receiver metadata,
  protocol/capability handling, and monitor/camping state for public KiwiSDR
  receivers, with new `get kiwi` / `get kiwisdr` automation-bridge snapshots.
  Clean-room per Constitution Principle IV. (#3898)
- **Automation bridge — `get dsp`, `streams resync`, `selectRow` / `window`
  verbs.** A `get dsp` model for the client-side AetherDSP modules (NR2 / NR4 /
  MNR / DFNR / RN2 / BNR), `streams resync` to force the radio to re-dump its
  display inventory, item-view row selection, and top-level window state control
  — plus a TX-guard fix so the RX-only "Tune Now" button is no longer wrongly
  blocked, and a11y names on the six DSP buttons. (#3920)

### Changed

- **BNR's container/microservice (NIM, gRPC) backend was removed.** BNR is now
  purely the local in-process AFX denoiser — ham operators shouldn't have to
  stand up a container to denoise audio. This also drops the grpc/protobuf build
  dependency entirely. BNR is auto-disabled in digital/CW modes and accents the
  ADSP launcher like the other client-NR engines. (#3902)
- **Faster panadapters — 60 fps ceiling and a per-pixel GPU FFT trace.** The 2D
  spectrum trace is now evaluated per pixel on the GPU from a single column
  texture, eliminating the per-frame CPU vertex bake (pan main-thread prep
  dropped ~5×). Data-driven repaints coalesce into one present per 16 ms slot,
  and the FFT frame-rate ceiling is raised from 30 to 60 fps. A new
  `get panstats` bridge verb reports per-panadapter frame-cost counters for
  before/after profiling. (#3958)
- **Model capabilities now sourced from FlexLib.** Extended-DSP (NRS/RNN/NRF)
  and diversity gating migrated from hand-maintained model-name sniffing to the
  FlexLib `ModelCapabilities` table (Principle I), fixing the AU-510 and
  "S"-variant (MLS-9601 / CLS-9301) extended-DSP toggles that never appeared,
  correcting diversity for FLEX-6500 (now off) and dual-SCU ML/CL/MLS/CLS models
  (now on), and refreshing the flag when a late `model` status arrives. All 23
  current FlexLib models resolve. (#3954, #2177)
- **Cut RX speaker latency for USB and local audio.** The app-side RX buffer cap
  default drops from 200 ms to 100 ms and the Windows RX sink now requests an
  explicit 50 ms device buffer, taking the worst-case Windows USB path from
  ~300–500 ms toward ~150 ms. Still fully adjustable (50–1000 ms) for
  VPN/SmartLink users who need a larger cushion. (#3897)
- **Display pane grouped into labeled sections.** The panadapter's Display panel
  is split into six labeled, divided sections — Panadapter, Waterfall,
  Background, Appearance, 3D View, System — and the background-off gesture is now
  a dedicated **Off** button instead of an undiscoverable right-click on Clear. (#3935)

### Fixed

- **Windows multi-pan crash.** The QRhiWidget cleanup callback is now
  deregistered on all GPU platforms, fixing a crash when tearing down
  panadapters on Windows. (#3922)
- **Profile Switcher swallowed the first Space PTT / CW key.** The non-editable
  Profile Switcher combo no longer eats the first Space press after gaining
  focus. (#3926)
- **New Panadapter Cancel button overlapped the layout grid.** The layout-picker
  window now sizes its height to the content, so the Cancel button sits below the
  thumbnail grid instead of on top of the bottom row. (#3941)
- **RC-28 auto-snap now sticks.** After the 600 ms auto-snap rounds to the
  nearest 1 kHz, the wheel accumulator is re-based to the snapped frequency, so
  the next knob tick no longer resumes from the stale pre-snap target and undoes
  the snap. (#3940)
- **KiwiSDR 3D trace / waterfall alignment.** DSS history is preserved and
  reprojected when the visible frequency frame changes during pan/zoom, keeping
  the 3D stacked trace aligned with the waterfall on Kiwi receivers and
  eliminating a one-frame line flash. (#3942)
- **Cross-band net tune routed through the canonical tune policy.** (#3921)
- **DX spot tooltip blocked by the passband hit-test.** Hovering a DX spot inside
  the active slice passband now shows its tooltip; the spot hit-test runs ahead
  of the passband cursor check, matching the click path. (#3903)
- **TCI TX resamples from the client-declared rate, not a hardcoded 48 kHz.** A
  TCI client that negotiated 8/12/24 kHz and then transmitted was mis-pitched
  (tones offset, digital decodes failing); TX now resamples from each frame's
  declared rate. WSJT-X (48 kHz) is unaffected. (#3892)
- **TCI TX soak-telemetry field rename** (`inputFrames48k` / `input48k=`) for
  accuracy. (#3924)
- **QsoRecorder playback stuck-mute on sink-open failure.** If the playback sink
  failed to open, live RX could be muted with no path to unmute until restart;
  the failure path now returns with RX left live. (#3891)
- **Auto-unkey momentary keyboard PTT/CW on focus loss and modifier-release**, so
  a held key can't leave the radio stuck keyed. (#3890)
- **Antenna Genius Port B visibility on manual-IP connections.** AetherSDR now
  probes the device with `info get` to read the authoritative port/antenna
  counts, restoring Port B parity with the UDP-discovery path for 2-radio-input
  hardware. (#3900)
- **Windows manifest embedded via `target_sources`** rather than a linker flag,
  fixing the build. (#3947)

## [v26.6.5] — 2026-06-28

### KiwiSDR receive sync + SmartMTR TX meters + Profile Switcher applet + agent automation bridge expansion

50 commits since v26.6.4. Headlined by **KiwiSDR receive sync** (GCC-PHAT
audio + visual alignment between the Flex and a public Kiwi), **SmartMTR TX
meters** (SWR / forward-power / compression gauges for the VFO flag), a new
**PROF profile-switcher applet** for live Global/TX/Mic profile selection, and a
large **agent automation/test bridge** expansion (radio connect/disconnect,
display-stream leak detection, custom context-menu inspection, and a
panadapter/waterfall control surface) — plus a broad wave of spectrum, VFO-flag,
and KiwiSDR stability fixes.

### Added

- **KiwiSDR receive sync** — GCC-PHAT Auto-Assist that time-aligns the Flex and a
  public KiwiSDR receiver in both audio and the spectrum/waterfall. (#3872)
- **SmartMTR TX meters** — selectable SWR, forward-power, and compression gauges
  with analog ballistics for the VFO flag meter. (#3776)
- **PROF (Profile Switcher) applet** — live Global / TX / Mic profile selection
  from a sidebar applet. (#3829)
- **Resizable CW decode panel** with an adjustable, persistent font size. (#3824)
- **APRS message-services picker** on the Recipient field. (#3828)
- **RC-28 rotation-sensitivity divider** with auto-snap to 1 kHz. (#3875)
- **SWR sweep CSV export.** (#3882)
- **Master Volume Up/Down configurable keyboard shortcuts.** (#3820)
- **S-meter config context menu** plus a needle pivot cover with a themed
  backlight glow (both tokenized for the theme subsystem). (#3859)
- **Agent automation bridge — major expansion:** radio connect/disconnect
  commands (#3851); radio-side display-stream inventory + leak detection
  (`streams` verb) that surfaces leaked/duplicate panadapter & waterfall streams
  `get pans` can't show (#3856); the `contextMenu` verb to trigger/inspect custom
  right-click menus (#3883); observability fields plus close/drag/showMenu/pan
  verbs, grab pan, and a token-anchored TX guard (#3842); a Panadapter/Waterfall
  control surface — antennas, CWX, floors, pan management (#3832); and bridge
  fidelity for slice TX, key/PTT, menu reachability, lineedit submit, resize, and
  multi-instance station identity (#3819). RX/observe verbs are observe-only; see
  `docs/automation-bridge.md`.

### Changed

- **WFM toggle relocated to the DAX pan menu** so the frequency digits no longer
  clip. (#3853)
- **KiwiSDR audio mutes during non-FDX transmit.** (#3865)
- **AetherDSP Settings now toggle from the DSP-tab ADSP button.** (#3881)
- **PTT (Hold) honors its reassigned key** instead of a hardcoded Space. (#3884)
- **ADSP launcher accents** when a client NR module is active. (#3822)
- **`pan close` verb** drives the production `RadioModel::removePanadapter`
  teardown path instead of duplicating the commands. (#3843)
- **GPU flag-sprite machinery excised** — slice flags are now always live. (#3806)
- CI: SHA-pinned actions drop version comments to stop Dependabot drift (#3867);
  `actions/cache` → 6.1.0 (#3864); `actions/setup-python` → 6.3.0 (#3863).

### Fixed

- **Closing a panafall-created panadapter now frees its waterfall stream on the
  radio** — the teardown now sends the FlexLib-correct Panadapter.Close +
  Waterfall.Close pair through `RadioModel::removePanadapter`. (#3843, #3855)
- **KiwiSDR proxy redirect transport** (proxy → proxy2). (#3850)
- **Kiwi waterfall pan/zoom stalls** — moved off the GUI thread. (#3825)
- **VOX-keyed transmit** now engages the SmartMTR TX meter and audio gate. (#3862)
- **Pan Lock** stands down during a slice drag and recenters on release. (#3786)
- **VFO flag-side pan following** and **diversity-pair flag placement**. (#3866, #3880)
- **Zoomed FFT spectrum rendering.** (#3836)
- **Smooth FFT trace + clamped display scale**, with EMA reset on TX→RX so the
  floor doesn't linger. (#3847, #3831)
- **DAX RX stream create/remove storm** that dropped connection quality to red. (#3796)
- **Keyboard/space PTT** routed through the Quindar coordinator. (#3798)
- **AetherControl window** clamped to the screen height. (#3795)
- **Panadapter split-pair** shown for an externally-initiated split. (#3794)
- **SpotHub clear buttons** persist; counter-desync and console-clear fixes. (#3823)
- **Floating window fill** for width-capped applets. (#3827)
- Automation: widget click/toggle deferred out of the socket read callback (#3826);
  tightened mark→tail log correlation (#3793).
- CWX drift-test teardown heap-use-after-free. (#3799)

### Performance

- **VITA-49 RX buffer** default raised to 4 MiB with an operator-adjustable
  slider — eliminates burst drops and auto-throttle fps caps. (#3811)
- Reuse GPU FFT-trace vertex scratch buffers + guard against a 1-bin spectrum. (#3782)
- Skip overlay re-bake on cursor-move when no readout is shown. (#3780)

### Removed

- Dead `m_overlayDynamic` overlay image (#59a19681), leftover `RxApplet.h.bak`
  (#3818), and a reverted half-baked frequency shrink-to-fit (#3846, #3839).

## [v26.6.4] — 2026-06-23

### KiwiSDR public-receiver browser + SmartMTR meter view + agent automation bridge + GPU-composite flags + accessibility

80 commits since v26.6.3. Headlined by a **KiwiSDR public-receiver
integration**, a selectable **SmartMTR meter view** for the VFO flag, an in-app
**agent automation/test bridge** for the GUI, **GPU-composited slice flags** with
a multi-GPU render selector, a first **accessibility** pass for custom-painted
widgets, and a large round of **CAT/rigctld parity** fixes. Governance moves to
**Constitution v2.0.0**.

### New features

- **KiwiSDR public-receiver browser** — an API-policy-aware directory browser to
  find and connect to public KiwiSDR receivers worldwide, independent of the
  FlexRadio path. Honest, policy-aware receiver picker with the public-directory
  **Limits** marker; diversity receive interlock with receive-only TX inhibit on
  Kiwi panadapters; source-attributed terminal denial messages (badp codes + MSG
  keys); clearer connection-failure messages; dedicated Support-menu logging
  categories. See `docs/kiwisdr-public-directory.md`. (#3668, #3679, #3676, #3678,
  #3699, #3706, #3707, #3716, #3749, #3759)
- **SmartMTR selectable meter view** for the VFO flag — an opt-in alternative to
  the S-meter (which stays pixel-identical when not selected). Analog d'Arsonval
  bar ballistics, sliding-window min/max "extremes" markers (1s/3s/5s), optional
  numeric value labels, and a TX mic-level meter. Renders correctly in the GPU
  flag-sprite path. (#3723, #3750, #3751, #3752, #3753, #3760, #3771)
- **Agent automation / test bridge** — an in-app, agent-drivable bridge for the
  GUI (`dumpTree`/`grab`/`invoke`/`get`, slice/VFO verbs), with TX automation
  hardening (meter freshness, ATU, two-tone, safety rails), input validation,
  redaction of masked fields, and a log-observability suite. Off in production,
  gated behind `AETHER_AUTOMATION`. See `docs/automation-bridge.md`. (#3646,
  #3710, #3722, #3727, #3728, #3738, #3717, #3747)
- **GPU-composite slice flags** instead of translucent raster siblings — removes
  the main-thread re-blend over the QRhi waterfall each frame, plus a multi-GPU
  **render-GPU selector** (Display menu) for multi-adapter systems and a
  flag re-raster pause when a flag isn't presented. (#3617, #3695, #3656, #3746,
  #3713)
- **Accessibility** — `QAccessibleInterface` implementations for custom-painted
  widgets (a Grouping summary for the VFO flag; the ESC level bar), backed by a
  new CI accessibility static-analysis check. See `docs/a11y.md`. (#3754, #3758)
- **Net Reminder Scheduler** — recurring net reminders with one-click tuning.
  (#3684)
- **PSK Reporter map** gains band-condition shading, a lookback window, and a
  hover card, with cross-platform spot-delivery fixes. (#3635)
- **FreeDV Reporter**: 6m+ band coverage and multi-select. (#3591)
- Maidenhead **grid-locator** field in the APRS position row. (#3672)
- **Memory** editor: NUL sanitisation, field dropdowns, smoother editing. (#3657)
- Continuous **edge auto-pan** while dragging a slice. (#3581)
- Status-bar **date** follows the system locale. (#3690)
- **Support bundles** are deflate-compressed. (#3691)
- **Waveform** install over the Docker file-upload protocol. (#3585)

### CAT / rigctld parity

- Resolve SmartSDR Flex/TS-2000 split-behavior gaps + block TS-2000 satellite-mode
  TX. (#3739)
- Resolve rigctld behavior gaps and fix on-demand split VFO. (#3724)
- Match missing Hamlib rigctld functionality — VFO mode, mode mapping, CTCSS/FM
  tones, levels & funcs. (#3619)
- **Behaviour:** VFO B is a dialect capability — disabled for rigctld, preserved
  across dialect switches and smaller-radio reconnects. (#3694/#3698)
- Don't cap running CAT ports by receiver count. (#3693/#3697)
- **Fix (safety):** a bare `ZZTX;` is a read, not a key — no more uncommanded TX
  in the Flex dialect. (#3625/#3629)
- Make the CAT per-port enable toggle visible. (#3618)

### Fixes & hardening

- **TCI DAX RX audio** routed by a cached channel→TRX map, resilient to transient
  `dax=0`; cache cleared on disconnect teardown. (#3669/#3759, #3766/#3767)
- **Crash:** guard the slice DAX-recall single-shot against a dangling slice
  (use-after-free). (#3733)
- **Live state (Principle II):** `setDax`, `setCwSidetone`, `setSbMonitor`, and
  `setAmCarrierLevel` now update their cached state optimistically. (#3737, #3736,
  #3734, #3712)
- Reproject only the active waterfall stream while panning. (#3700/#3701)
- Draw the panadapter grid below the FFT trace in the GPU path. (#3606/#3713)
- Use the radio's auto-black level for an evenly-levelled waterfall floor. (#3586)
- Independently themable **LIVE** chip (red live / grey history). (#3761)
- Pace TX waterfall rows to `line_duration` to match the RX scroll rate. (#3686)
- Profile FFT settling on load. (#3604, #3573)
- Prune dead followers in `AudioOutputRouter`. (#3660/#3661)
- Capture TX audio in client-side QSO recordings. (#3556/#3632)
- Run the CWX local sidetone keyer on a `steady_clock` worker thread. (#3644)
- Stream Deck Tune Toggle parsed the wrong TCI status field. (#3647)
- Migrate hardcoded highlight/disabled-state colours to ThemeManager tokens
  (Principle IX); persist Theme Editor overrides under pre-seeded applet scopes.
  (#3645, #3688)
- Ulanzi dial on Linux: detect an inaccessible evdev device and offer a one-click
  udev grant. (#3677)
- RX BW indicator shows bandwidth, not the hi-cut. (#3659/#3696)
- Idle MOX button gets a distinct accent so it reads as the transmit button.
  (#3763)
- Fan-mode button label clarity; Fahrenheit toggle for amplifier temperature.
  (#3651, #3652)

### Internal — audio sink factory (Phase 6, #3306)

- New `AudioOutputRouter` registry for output-following sinks; Pudu/QSO/CW and
  Quindar sinks finished onto the factory with format negotiated through it.
  (#3630, #3631, #3655)
- Architecture note: WebSDR-sourced VFO/slice design. (#3621)

### Governance

- **Constitution v2.0.0** — trims the domain conventions (relocated to
  `AGENTS.md`) and adds governance principles; net 14 principles. (#3602)

### Packaging / CI

- Build and bundle **qtkeychain** for SmartLink credential persistence on the
  Linux **AppImage** (#3640) and **Windows** (#3634).
- **Pin + verify SHA256** for all `third_party` setup-script downloads. (#3665/#3692)
- **AppStream metainfo** for Linux + Flathub-submission polish; a simple
  **manpage**. (#3673, #3709, #3674)
- Dependabot: `actions/checkout` 6.0.3→7.0.0, `microsoft-store-apppublisher`
  1.1→1.3, `action-gh-release` 3.0.0→3.0.1. (#3682, #3681, #3680)

## [v26.6.3] — 2026-06-14

### Satellite WFM + APRS/PSK-Reporter mapping + packet AFSK + MainWindow decomposition

58 commits since v26.6.2. Headlined by a WFM software demodulator for
satellite data, an APRS client and a PSK Reporter reception map built on a new
reusable Qt mapping engine, a Direwolf-derived VHF packet demodulator, and the
internal #3351 decomposition of the MainWindow monolith.

### New features

- **WFM software demodulator** for satellite data work (G3RUH 9600 bd):
  DAX IQ → SkyRoof-parity DSP chain (phase-continuous NCO Doppler correction,
  exact 48 kHz resampling, flat atan2 discriminator) → virtual audio cable for
  HS-SoundModem. Per-slice WFM toggle on FM modes. (#3407, #3522, #3562)
- **APRS client** — the AetherModem AX.25 tab becomes a lightweight APRS
  client: live station table with wireframe symbol icons and weather decode, a
  timed GPS position beacon (grid-locator fallback), and two-way messaging with
  retries, auto-ack, and digipeat de-duplication — all on the shared one-at-a-
  time TX keying queue. (#3530)
- **PSK Reporter reception map** (View ▸ PSK Reporter) showing who is hearing
  your callsign on an OpenStreetMap basemap — mode-coloured markers, great-circle
  paths, live MQTT feed plus HTTP polling, persistent spot cache. Built on a new
  **reusable Qt mapping engine** (vendored QGeoView, LGPL-3.0) intended for reuse
  by the APRS tab. (#3565)
- **Direwolf-derived AFSK demodulator** for VHF 1200-baud AX.25, replacing
  libmodem's AFSK on the VHF path (HF 300-baud unchanged). A 1,875-packet
  overnight comparator beat both Direwolf and Graywolf on copy rate. (#3527)
- **DAX-IQ fully usable** — end-to-end IQ sample delivery, a dBFS level meter,
  24/48/96/192 kHz rate switching with persistence, and startup state restore.
  (#2529, #3521, #3522)

### Packet radio

- `HdlcCodec`: pure-C++ HDLC framer replacing libmodem's `bitstream_state`. (#3475)
- AX.25 shim isolated on a dedicated `QThread`. (#3473)
- MQTT: per-topic control, CW keyer, radio state, AX.25, debug logging. (#3460)

### Fixes & hardening

- **Behaviour change (CAT):** rigctl/TCI `set_freq` retunes that stay within the
  panadapter span no longer recenter the pan (`autopan=0`); cross-band tunes
  still recenter, preserving the #536 behaviour. Satellite trackers issuing
  Doppler steps every few seconds previously yanked the pan on every step.
- Profile-load recovery hardening for Multi-Flex — suppress/defer profile-owned
  slice/pan/waterfall writes during global profile restore. (#3563)
- DEXP controls now use the `compander`/`compander_level` protocol keys SmartSDR
  actually uses (were silently rejected). (#3568)
- Multi-Flex ping-watchdog grace during a second client's join, so AetherSDR no
  longer false-disconnects mid-join. (#3570)
- TCI: dB on the wire for the VOLUME command; `ready;` sent after the full
  settings dump, not mid-burst. (#3498, #3502)
- ARRL US bandplan license-class accuracy. (#3518)
- Narrow-passband drag hit-testing. (#3523)
- GPU spectrum builds without `Qt6GuiPrivate` (Windows/macOS aqtinstall). (#3561)
- Keep inactive-slice bandwidth visible via a neutral colour rather than
  near-invisible dimming. (#3484/#2389)
- Per-row waterfall-history frequency frames (no per-pan reproject). (#3578)
- TMate2 enhanced display — TX bargraph, text overlays, encoder labels. (#3542)
- RC-28 velocity-proportional tuning. (#3467)
- SmartSDR-parity **"Purple"** waterfall colour scheme — additive and opt-in,
  joining the existing presets. (#3583)

### Internal — MainWindow decomposition (#3351)

- `MainWindow.cpp` reduced from ~19,500 to ~8,100 lines, split across sibling
  translation units (`MainWindow_Controllers/Menus/Shortcuts/Wiring/DigitalModes/
  SwrSweep/Spots/Session/DspApplets.cpp`, `MainWindowHelpers`,
  `MainWindowShortcutState.h`) — pure code motion, no behaviour change. Mapped in
  `docs/architecture/mainwindow-decomposition.md`.
- New **`RadioSession`** aggregate owns `RadioModel` + `TciServer` + `CatPorts`
  per radio, making teardown order structural (fixes the #2385 crash-on-quit
  class). (#3544, #3545)

### Packaging / CI

- Microsoft Store: a `v*` release tag now auto-stages a **draft** submission via
  the `msstore` CLI — safe-by-construction (SHA-pinned action, secrets via env,
  tag + opt-in + fork gates, `--noCommit`), dormant until credentials are set.
  (#3567)

## [v26.6.2] — 2026-06-07

### Theming + HID controllers + packet-radio suite + Windows Store + 206-commit consolidation

206 commits across 18 contributors since v26.5.3. This is a consolidated
**v26.6.2** that rolls up the 26.6.1 feature wave, the v26.6.1.1 hotfixes,
and a large block of new work landed since — headlined by the runtime
theming system, three new HID controller classes, a full packet-radio
suite (KISS TNC, connected-mode BBS terminal, and a personal mailbox),
and the Microsoft Store (MSIX) packaging path for one-click install and
automatic updates on Windows.

### Theming foundation (early beta)

A runtime theming system, opt-in via **Settings → Theme Editor**; Default
Dark remains the shipped default. Token names, the `.aethertheme` format,
and the editor UX are expected to change before stabilising — file issues
with the `theme` label if you try it.

- `ThemeManager` foundation + 51-token design taxonomy, gradient + alpha support
- Theme Editor dialog with live colour editing, gradient editor, font + sizing pickers
- New **Default Light** theme; `.aethertheme` import/export with drag-and-drop
- Embedded DSEG Modern 7- and 14-segment fonts (SIL OFL 1.1)

### HID input devices

Three new physical-device classes, all opt-in so the macOS Input
Monitoring prompt never surfaces unless an operator enables one:

- **Elgato StreamDeck+** — encoders, LCD buttons, touchscreen with live labels (#3236)
- **Ulanzi Dial** — cross-platform on Linux evdev, Windows, and macOS (#3238, #3239)
- **Native Icom RC-28** encoder support (#3293, #3298)

### Packet radio — KISS TNC, BBS terminal & mailbox

AetherModem grows from a decoder into a complete packet station, all over
its built-in 1200-baud VHF (Bell 202) AFSK modem — no external TNC
hardware required:

- **KISS-over-TCP TNC server (#3279)** — turns AetherSDR into a software TNC
  for any host packet/APRS app (Xastir, YAAC, APRSdroid, UISS, Dire
  Wolf-style clients, terminal programs). Cross-platform `QTcpServer` with
  multiple simultaneous clients, resync-safe KISS framing (FEND/FESC), and
  proper lifecycle handling — TCP keepalive, slow-consumer write-backlog
  cap, and an idle sweep so dead clients are reaped, not leaked. **Enable
  TNC**, **Start on Startup**, and **TCP port** (default 8001) controls,
  all persisted.
- **Standalone packet terminal (#3381)** — a built-in connected-mode AX.25
  client in a new Terminal tab: call a 1200-baud VHF packet BBS, read and
  send messages, and disconnect, with reliable error correction (T1
  retries) over the half-duplex link. Verified on the air against a live
  BBS (SJVBBS-1).
- **Personal Mailbox System (PMS)** — the answering-side counterpart: your
  own connected-mode AX.25 mailbox other stations can connect to, sharing
  the same `Ax25Connection` data-link state machine as the terminal.
- Built on the **AX.25 1200-baud VHF (Bell 202) RX + TX** profiles from
  earlier in the cycle (#3253, #3256).

### Windows Store — one-click install & automatic updates

AetherSDR is heading to the Microsoft Store as an MSIX package, so Windows
operators get one-click installation and automatic background updates
instead of chasing installers:

- **MSIX packaging groundwork + Store app identity** (#3178, #3225)
- **Lean Store payload** — DFNR neural-denoiser weights embedded for the
  Store build, with the model archive excluded from the MSIX package to
  keep it small (#3225, #3205)
- **CI builds and attaches the MSIX / `.msixupload`** to every release,
  with the Store-submission automation plan documented (#3281)

### Other new work since v26.6.1

- **Accessibility, Phase 2 (#3303)** — accessible widget names, live
  screen-reader announcements, VFO tab navigation, and full keyboard
  navigation.
- **Ulanzi Studio sibling plugin (#3227)** — `ulanzi-aethersdr` alongside
  the in-app mapper.
- **Filter passband shading fix (#3294)** — premultiplied-alpha
  double-multiply on the GPU path corrected.

### Hotfixes folded in (originally v26.6.1.1)

- **macOS DMG release build unblocked (#3349)** — a removed background image
  plus a masked `|| true` broke create-dmg; Apple Silicon DMG now builds,
  signs, and notarizes cleanly.
- **Tuning-step toast no longer fires on radio syncs (#3337)**.
- **Radio Setup tall tabs stay reachable (#3347)** — tab pages wrapped in a
  scroll area.

### Windows hardening

- PerMonitorV2 DPI awareness (#3208), discrete-GPU preference on hybrid laptops (#3299)
- Windows Snap restoration for the frameless title bar (#3069), WASAPI CW sidetone routing (#3241)

### New protocol surfaces

- **SmartCAT TCP server** — TS-2000 + FlexCAT dialects (#3131)
- **Unified RADE TX pipeline** — EOO frame transmission + callsign encoding (#3221)
- **SSDR-parity PWR/SWR metering** on PGXL/TGXL amplifier applets (#3277)
- TCI `clicked_on_spot` event for Log4OM interoperability (#3145)

### Reliability sweep

- **Faster connect times** — ~1.3 s cut off the connect handshake by
  skipping the peek when multiFLEX is on and pipelining the serial
  subscriptions (#3391)
- **Steadier discovery** — the re-bind loop now pauses while connected and
  fully quiesces on routed/WAN links, so reconnects stop fighting the
  discovery socket (#3420, #3422)
- **7-year-old NR2 Gamma crackling fix** — SpectralNR Bessel function variants corrected (#3275)
- **Multi-monitor main-window restore under Minimal Mode** (#3174)
- **Multi-pan TCI spot freeze** — spot-marker rebuilds coalesced (#3310)
- **FreeDV / Quindar interactions** (#3317, #3320) + RADE filter passband alignment (#3301)

### Build, CI, and packaging

- **`check-windows` + `check-macos` always run** on every PR (#3244)
- **Sanitizer step pinned to bash** so `pipefail` works (#3155); **SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH** reproducible builds (#3165)
- **System-library opt-in flags** + lowercase binary name + Linux 256×256 icon + `.desktop` description (#3135, #3138, #3143, #3074 — @dawkagaming)
- **Debian multiarch tuple for Qt6GuiPrivate probe** (#3159 — @K5PTB)

## [v26.6.1.1] — 2026-06-02

### Hotfix: macOS DMG release build + two GUI fixes

Three fixes on top of v26.6.1, no other changes:

- **fix(ci): unblock macOS DMG build broken by missing background image
  (#3349)** — the `create-dmg` invocation referenced
  `docs/assets/logo-invert.png`, which had been removed; the trailing
  `|| true` masked the failure and Sign DMG then failed on a DMG that was
  never produced. Drops the missing `--background`, adds an explicit
  `test -f` guard.
- **fix(gui): only toast "Step: …" on deliberate step changes, not radio
  syncs (#3337)** — the tuning-step toast no longer fires on radio-driven
  status syncs, only on deliberate user step changes.
- **fix(radio-setup): wrap tab pages in QScrollArea so tall tabs stay
  reachable (#3347)** — tall Radio Setup tabs are scrollable instead of
  clipping controls off-screen.

## [v26.6.1] — 2026-06-01

### HID input devices + Windows hardening + new protocol surfaces + 143-commit reliability sweep

143 commits across 14 contributors landed in this cycle. **HID input
device support** is the most user-visible new work, landing three new
device classes: the **Elgato StreamDeck+** (encoders + LCD buttons +
touchscreen labels), the **Ulanzi Dial** (cross-platform on Linux
evdev / Windows / macOS), and **native Icom RC-28** encoder support —
all opt-in so the macOS Input Monitoring prompt never surfaces unless
the operator explicitly enables one. **Windows hardening** sweeps
PerMonitorV2 DPI awareness, discrete-GPU preference on hybrid laptops,
MSIX packaging groundwork with embedded DFNR weights, Windows Snap
restoration for the frameless title bar, and WASAPI sidetone routing.
New protocol surfaces include the **SmartCAT TCP server** (TS-2000 +
FlexCAT dialects), a **unified RADE TX pipeline** with EOO frame
transmission and callsign encoding, **1200-baud VHF AX.25** RX + TX
via the in-process modem, and **SSDR-parity PWR/SWR metering** on the
PGXL/TGXL amplifier applets. A long-tail reliability sweep clears a
**7-year-old NR2 Gamma crackling bug** in the SpectralNR path (#1507),
fixes the **multi-monitor main-window restore** under Minimal Mode
(#2483), and resolves the **multi-pan TCI spot freeze** (#2481).

This release also lands the **groundwork for a runtime theming
system** — `ThemeManager` foundation, a 51-token design taxonomy, a
Theme Editor dialog, and a Default Light theme alongside the existing
dark. The theming work is **early beta**, opt-in via Settings → Theme
Editor; the Default Dark theme remains the shipped default. Token
names, the `.aethertheme` file format, and the editor UX are all
expected to change before stabilising. See the dedicated section below
for the phase-by-phase detail.

Big thanks to **@jensenpat** (22 commits — TCI/CAT, multi-monitor
restore, network diagnostics), **@aethersdr-agent** (the AetherClaude
orchestrator, 28 commits — landing across spectrum, audio, spot and
applet paths), **@NF0T** (10 commits — Windows packaging + DPI + DFNR
embedding + RADE TX pipeline), **@nigelfenton** (8 commits — TCI
fixes), **@M7HNF-Ian** (7 commits — XVTR, slice spawning, NR2 Gamma
fix), **@chibondking** (6 commits — bandplan corrections, panadapter
context slice spawning), **@K5PTB** (5 commits — MQTT publish topics,
CMake Debian multiarch fix), **@dawkagaming** (4 community PRs —
system-library opt-in flags, lowercase binary name, Linux icon size,
`.desktop` description), **@rfoust** (4 commits), and first-time
contributors **@w5jwp** (Icom RC-28 encoder support), **@motoham88**
(StreamDeck+ support), **@mvanhorn** (theme migration tool cleanup),
and **@VU3ESV** (macOS `phys_footprint` memory reporting).

### Headline features

**End-to-end theming system (#3076, Phases 1–6)**

Six-phase migration from scattered hex-literal paint calls to a
canonical token-based theming system:

- **Phase 1 — `ThemeManager` foundation** (#3077).
- **Phase 2 — 51-token design taxonomy** (#3080), gradient token support
  (#3084), widget→tokens reverse map with live re-theme (#3085),
  ComboStyle pilot migration to `applyStyleSheet` + tokens (#3087),
  app-wide stylesheet migration with `applyAppTheme()` (#3090), and the
  mass migration across 59 files / ~1000 hex literals (#3102). Audit
  tool `tools/audit_colours.py` shipped to drive the inventory (#3078).
- **Phase 3 — paint-code migration** in tranches: `MeterSlider`
  (#3106), the migration tool itself + `SpectrumWidget` (#3113),
  file-scope `const QColor` in comp/gate/curve widgets (#3116), and
  the spectrum + chain + waveform paint-code closeout (#3117).
- **Phase 4 — Default Light theme** ships alongside the existing dark
  default (#3129).
- **Phase 5 — Theme Editor dialog**: live colour editing + Save As
  (#3130), inspector mode + 505-site reverse-map sweep (#3144), alpha
  pipeline + `themeRegions` + glass-mode backdrop (#3148), gradient
  editor + meter-bar gradient + flat↔gradient conversion (#3158), font
  + sizing pickers + per-token reset + theme rename/delete (#3160).
- **Phase 6 — `.aethertheme` import/export with drag-and-drop** (#3164).
- **DSEG Modern fonts embedded** (SIL OFL 1.1) for the 7-segment and
  14-segment displays (#3163).

Plus the inline Theme Editor with auto-persist + built-in theme
protection (#3176), per-applet/per-tribe scoping for toggle-button
namespaces (#3198), per-applet overrides for sliders + knobs (#3188),
waterfall colormap runtime theming for all five presets (#3122), slice
indicator runtime theming (#3121), and the Theme Editor UX polish round
(#3199). Cleanup PRs along the way tokenized leftover slider call sites
(#3204), swapped `kGreenToggle` for `color.background.success` (#3195),
and rescued misattributed migration-tool comments (#3125).

**Elgato StreamDeck+ support (#3236, follow-up #3250)**

First-class StreamDeck+ integration — encoders, LCD buttons, and the
touchscreen with labels. Three robustness gaps surfaced in initial
review were addressed in the follow-up.

**Ulanzi Dial cross-platform support (#3238, #3239)**

Linux evdev backend with a visual configurator (#3238), then Windows
and macOS backends with a cross-platform mapper (#3239). Both
StreamDeck+ and the Ulanzi Dial are gated behind opt-in toggles in
Settings so the macOS Input Monitoring prompt only appears when the
operator explicitly enables either device (#3257).

**Icom RC-28 USB encoder support (#3293, #3171)**

Initial Icom RC-28 native support (#3293); also recognises a
community-built `aether-pad` RC-28 emulator via Arduino VID/PID alias
(#3171).

**SmartCAT TCP server (#3131)**

New TCP CAT server supporting both the Kenwood TS-2000 and FlexCAT
dialects. Joins the existing TCI, Hamlib NET rigctl, and per-slice
rigctld surfaces for CAT interop without external bridges.

**Unified RADE TX pipeline (#3221)**

RADE TX path consolidated, with EOO frame transmission and callsign
encoding embedded in the protocol — eliminates the previous
codec-specific tail handling and brings callsign metadata onto the
wire alongside the audio frames.

**HLTH antenna health applet (#3153)**

New applet for antenna health monitoring, built on the customizable
button-bar refactor (#3150).

**Customizable button bar (#3150)**

Favourites + push-down drawer pattern for the main button bar — operators
can pin frequently-used controls and let the rest live in the drawer.

**SSDR-parity PWR/SWR metering on PGXL/TGXL applets (#3277)**

The PGXL and TGXL amplifier applets gain SmartSDR-aligned PWR/SWR
meter rendering.

**Adaptive throttle UX (#3175, #3203)**

Network-congestion-adaptive panadapter throttle gets an explicit
toggle in the Connect panel for all modes (was previously WAN-only),
plus visibility through the status-bar heartbeat colour and the
Network Diagnostics dialog graphs.

**Bell 202 AX.25 1200-baud VHF (#3253, #3256)**

Receive (#3253) then transmit (#3256) profiles for 1200-baud VHF AX.25
packet radio via the in-process modem.

**MQTT publishes CW decoded text + publish-button topics surface (#3216, #3251)**

CW decoder output now publishes to `aethersdr/cw/decode` (#3216);
internal publish topics are visible in the Publish Buttons settings
tab (#3251).

**Reference target curve on Aetherial Parametric EQ (#3259)**

Visual reference overlay for matching a target frequency response.

**AetherControl double-click to latch (#3103)**

Replaces the click+ESC asymmetry with a single double-click gesture

Polar display for phase and gain now adjusts directly on click.

### Long-tail bugs landing in this cycle

**NR2 Gamma crackling — 7-year-old SpectralNR bug (#1507 → #3275)**

Inverted blue fill on EQ band sliders corrected.

**RF/Tune power slider unit labelling (#3284 → #3285)**

Sliders relabelled as percent (not watts) — matches what the radio

to FreeDV's symmetric passband (Principle I.).

**Quindar interactions (#3317, #3320)**

Quindar outro timer routed through `dispatchMoxOff()` (#3317); FreeDV
modes excluded from the Quindar tone allowlist (#3320).

check.

**XVTR LO Error units (#3272) + Max Power clamp (#3273)**

section above.

**HID hotplugCheck full scan + HAVE_HIDAPI guard (#3298)**

Hotplug scan now does a full pass instead of stopping at the first
matching device; `HAVE_HIDAPI` guard fixes for the no-HID build path.

Status-bar memory line uses the macOS `phys_footprint` rather than the
VM-size proxy.

**TGXL/PGXL socket release on shutdown (#3079 → #3083)** — Principle I.

**Slice indicator + waterfall colormap runtime theming (#3121, #3122)**

See theming section.

  styles consolidated into one `Theme.h` helper.
- **`connectSliderSetting` helper (#3032 → #3108)** — slider →
  `AppSettings` binding extracted; `WaveApplet` and `PanadapterApplet`
  migrated.
- **License-class filter-before-merge invariant (#3060 → #3089)** —
  band-plan walker invariant pinned.
- **ContainerWidget drag-MIME documentation (#3056 → #3096)** —
  TXDSP-style alias documented at the drag MIME-set call site
  (Principle III.).

### Diagnostics & support bundles

- **macOS `phys_footprint` in status-bar memory (#3197 → #3207)** — uses
  the macOS-native memory accounting rather than the VM-size proxy.
- **About dialog active pan renderer (#3097)** — surfaces GPU vs
  QPainter spectrum path.
- **Slice troubleshooter diagnostics (#3132)** — extra signals for the
  triage flow.
- **Network Diagnostics adaptive-throttle visibility (#3203)** —
  heartbeat colour + dialog graphs.

### Build, CI, and packaging

- **`check-macos` build gate for hot platform-guarded files (#3223)** —
  mirrors the `check-windows` pattern; covers AudioEngine/MainWindow.
- **AudioEngine added to `check-windows` filter (#3052 → #3210)** —
  catches WASAPI-related regressions before they hit main.
- **Always-on `check-windows` + `check-macos` on every PR (#3244)** —
  retires the path-filter allow-list. Cost: ~15–20 min runner time per
  PR; benefit: closes a recurring regression class. See PR body for
  the receipts.
- **Sanitizer step pinned to bash (#3155)** — `pipefail` + `PIPESTATUS`
  bashisms work; the previous Dash default was silently swallowing
  ctest exit codes and reporting clean runs.
- **CMake `/MANIFESTINPUT` + `/MANIFEST:EMBED` pairing (#3237)** —
  manifest embedding on MSVC.
- **`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` for reproducible builds (#3165)** — distro
  packagers can pin build timestamps.
- **Debian multiarch tuple for Qt6GuiPrivate probe (#3159)** — fixes
  the build on Debian-derived distros where Qt private headers live
  under the multiarch tuple path.
- **liquid-dsp AltiVec SIMD gate (#3072)** — only probe on PowerPC
  hosts.
- **liquid-dsp WIN32 link-flag guard (#3220)** — `-lc/-lm` only on
  POSIX.
- **System-library opt-in flags (#3135 — @dawkagaming)** —
  `USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB`, `USE_SYSTEM_MSPACK`, `USE_SYSTEM_LIBMOSQUITTO`,
  `USE_SYSTEM_RTMIDI`. Off by default so existing build hosts continue
  to use vendored snapshots; distro packagers turn them on to match
  dynamic-linking policy.
- **Lowercase binary name option (#3138 — @dawkagaming)** — convenience
  for distro packagers.
- **Linux 256×256 icon (#3143 — @dawkagaming)** — correct icon size for
  the Linux `.desktop` location.
- **Improved `.desktop` description (#3074 — @dawkagaming)** — Linux
  desktop integration polish.
- **Windows MSIX packaging groundwork (#3178)** + **embed DFNR model
  for Store (#3225)** + **exclude DFNR model archive from MSIX
  package (#3205)** — preparation for Microsoft Store distribution.
- **Native stored ZIPs for support bundles and profile backups (#3206)**
- **Theme-manager test fixture realignment (#3161 → #3166)** — fixture
  realigned with default-dark v1.3 token table; nullptr-deref guarded
  (Principle VIII.).
- **PerMonitorV2 DPI awareness on Windows (#3208)**
- **macOS bitmap cursor crash workaround (#3099)**

### Documentation

- **`docs/assets/`** — AetherSDR light + dark theme screenshots added,
  unused `logo-invert.png` removed (#824d58e6, #4670d1d6).
- **CODEOWNERS Tier 3 expansion (#3177)** — @chibondking added to the
  reviewer roster.
- **`ContainerWidget` drag-MIME cross-reference (#3096)** — code
  comment cross-referencing the TXDSP-style alias fallback (Principle
  III.).
- **CHANGELOG attribution corrections for v26.5.3 (#3067)** —
  @nigelfenton (Nigel G0JKN) and @G6PWY-Chris contributor handles fixed
  retroactively after they reported the misattributions directly.

## [v26.5.3] — 2026-05-24

### Aetherial Audio TX completion + security hardening + 100-commit reliability sweep

139 commits across 14 contributors landed in this cycle. The headline
work is the **TX path of the Aetherial Audio Channel Strip** reaching
feature-complete with the new PAPR processor and split-band de-esser,
**two published security advisories** landing their enforcement phases
(SmartLink TLS cert pinning + CAT PTY symlink hardening), the **MQTT
configuration moves into a dedicated Settings dialog** (separating
config from the live applet), and a substantial reliability sweep
across audio (WASAPI / CoreAudio / macOS mic), spectrum (TX waterfall
scroll rate, panadapter dBm prime), and CAT (rigctld, TCI, MIDI).
Native Hamlib NET rigctl ships as a first-class CAT path alongside TCI.

Big thanks to **@jensenpat** (16 commits — macOS audio, Windows COM
handle, TCI architecture), **@NF0T** (Ryan B, 12 commits — Windows
installer + RADE + various), **@rfoust** (Robbie Foust, 9 commits —
FlexControl wheel UX overhaul), **@Ozy311** (5 commits — BYPASS state
persistence, applet float/dock title-bar sync, ProfileManager auto-save
signal, DX Spots slider cap, BYPASS tooltip), **@nigelfenton** (Nigel
Fenton, G0JKN, 5 commits — TCI Network dialog tab, tx_gain + ALC, use-
after-free fix, vfo emit on band-change, mic-capture suppress during
TCI feed), **@chibondking** (CJ Johnson, 5 commits — panadapter dBm
prime fix), **@M8WLO** (Andy, 4 commits), **@s53zo** (2 commits —
substantial MQTT settings dialog refactor with self-found subscription-
state fix), **@pepefrog1234** (2 commits — the macOS silent-SSB-TX fix
+ set_split_vfo ping-pong fix), **@K5PTB** (2 commits), **@G6PWY-Chris**
(Chris G6PWY, 1 commit), and **@aethersdr-agent** (the AetherClaude orchestrator,
22 commits — automated fixes on `aetherclaude-eligible` issues).
Dependabot contributed 6 security and version bumps.

### Security advisories landed in this release

**GHSA-wfx7-w6p8-4jr2 — SmartLink TLS cert pin enforcement (Phase 2, #3026)**

Phase 1 (warn-only) shipped in v26.5.2; Phase 2 promotes the cert-
fingerprint mismatch to a **hard handshake-pause**. On a mismatch the
client emits a modal dialog (Accept new cert / Reject and disconnect)
before sending `wan validate`, so a MITM-side attacker never sees an
authenticated session. New SmartLink tab in Radio Setup lists pinned
certificates with per-row Forget and Forget All. Pin cache schema
migrates Phase 1 string entries to Phase 2 `{fp, pinnedAt}` objects
on first save.

**GHSA-qxhr-cwrc-pvrm — RigctlPty symlink out of /tmp (#3027)**

The convenience symlink for CAT software auto-discovery now lives in
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/aethersdr/cat-A` (Linux) or
`~/Library/Caches/AetherSDR/cat-A` (macOS) instead of the cross-user
`/tmp` location. Atomic symlink replacement via `symlink(.tmp)` +
`rename(.tmp, final)` closes the TOCTOU window the old
unlink-then-symlink had on non-sticky filesystems.

Additional defense-in-depth fixes: PII log-redactor regex tightening
(#2954), read-buffer caps on radio/WAN/DxCluster sockets (#2955),
callsign sanitisation in WAV recording paths to handle `/M`/`/P`/`/MM`
(#2956), atomic-rename log symlink (#2957).

### Headline features

**Aetherial Audio Channel Strip TX path completion (#3024)**

- **PAPR processor** — new all-pass biquad cascade (4 stages at
  300/700/1500/2500 Hz) for peak-to-average-power-ratio reduction.
  Drive (0–18 dB) + Phase knobs in the channel strip; auto-makeup gain
  linked to Drive so RMS lifts alongside peaks instead of disappearing
  into the compressor's gain reduction.
- **Split-band de-esser** — replaces the old broadband-attenuation
  pattern (`l *= gainLin; r *= gainLin;`) with
  `output = full + bandpass × (gain − 1)`. Fixes the broadband-
  attenuation bug that was costing operators ~30W of forward power on
  voice content (reported externally as "DESS reduces TX power to ~70W
  of 100W expected"). User-selectable cascade stages (12/24/36/48 dB/oct)
  via a left-aligned toggle in the DESS panel.
- **Peak-hold toggle** on all meters; CRST + RMS + THRESH styling
  unified via the canonical `MeterSmoother` (30 ms attack / 180 ms
  release at 120 Hz).
- **10 Hz throttle** on text readouts; live response at 125 Hz —
  meters track the audio without spamming the GUI thread.

**Native Hamlib NET rigctl implementation (#2975)**

Full 149-test rigctld implementation for WSJT-X / JTDX / fldigi /
Winlink VARA / N1MM+ / DXLog interoperability without a standalone
rigctld bridge. Slices A–H each expose a TTY (per-user runtime path
on Linux + macOS, see #3027) and a TCP port (4532–4539).

**TX waterfall scroll rate matches RX (#3031)**

After #3019 stabilised TX waterfall rendering across slices, the FFT-
derived row path scrolled at `line_duration` cadence (~10 rows/sec)
while RX native tiles arrived at the FFT rate (~30 rows/sec) — TX
appeared 3× slower than RX. Diagnosed via inline probe; corrected by
dropping the FFT row throttle and emitting one row per FFT frame,
matching native-tile behaviour. The original assumption that native
tiles arrive at `line_duration` was wrong; they arrive at FFT rate.

**WASAPI mono-only USB PnP mic silent-open recovery (#2929)**

Some USB PnP mics report mono-only capture natively; Qt accepts an
unsupported stereo open and returns a non-null `QIODevice` that
delivers zero bytes. Three-layer fix:

1. Pre-emptive channel-count clamp from `dev.maximumChannelCount()`
   before format selection (catches the obvious mono-only mics).
2. Fallback-ladder fix to skip only the exact failed `(rate, ch)`
   combo instead of the whole rate (catches mono-only mics whose
   fallback was suppressed).
3. 1.5 s silent-open watchdog that tears down and retries as mono if
   no bytes arrive — covers mics that lie about `maximumChannelCount`.

**Panadapter dBm range prime on reconnect (#3034 — @chibondking)**

Secondary panadapters (Slices B–H) could go completely flat on
reconnect with the dBm scale stuck at the default `[-50, +50]` while
the radio's saved range was different. Cause traced end-to-end: noise-
floor auto-adjust animated from the wrong baseline, fired
`dbmRangeChangeRequested` with bogus values, and the `pendingDbm`
guard locked them in. Fix: prime the spectrum widget with the pan's
current dBm range immediately on wire so the auto-adjust starts from
the right baseline. Solid community contribution.

**FlexControl wheel tuning overhaul (#3029 — @rfoust)**

Two-axis quality-of-life improvement to the virtual FlexControl wheel:

- New **Mouse Sensitivity** slider alongside the existing Wheel
  Tightness, with midpoint (50) returning `1.0` scale — old behaviour
  preserved as default.
- **De-jitter**: clamps single-event pointer deltas to 15° (`π/12`),
  prevents huge wheel kicks from fast mouse jumps.
- **Lazy re-anchoring**: when the pointer crosses through the centre
  dead-zone, the anchor is dropped; next movement out of the dead-zone
  re-anchors without computing a delta. Stops the "wild swing on
  centre crossing" pattern.
- **Coast / pointer clock separation**: coast only starts when both
  instant and blended velocities exceed 4.0 rad/s; pointer input within
  32 ms of a tick suppresses coast ticks. Slow mouse drags no longer
  trigger free coasting.
- UI: centred slider title labels, Tight/Loose + Less/More endpoints,
  two-column layout.

**ATU pre-tune Auto-mode safety nets (#3050)**

Four-layer guardrail bundle for the unattended ATU sweep:

- **License-class filter** (data-driven from active bandplan's optional
  `license_classes` block — ARRL US ships with `{T, G, E}` populated;
  combobox hidden when active plan has no class structure). Prevents a
  Tech-class operator from keying into General/Extra-only sub-bands
  during the unattended sweep.
- **Max-points soft cap** at 100 with mm:ss TX-duration warning.
- **High-power warning** (warn, not refuse, per Principle XIII) when
  Auto-mode tune power exceeds 20 W.
- **Audible cue** on per-point timeout + 3-fail bypass abort.

**ATU pre-tune per-band early exit (#3063)**

Three consecutive fail-bypass on a band now skips past that band's
remaining points and continues on the next band instead of aborting
the whole sweep. Useful when only one antenna is bad (broken feedline
on 80m, fine on 40m/20m/15m).

**Windows hybrid-GPU support (#1921)**

`NvOptimusEnablement = 1` and `AmdPowerXpressRequestHighPerformance = 1`
exports so the Windows binary launches on the discrete GPU on hybrid
laptops. Sidesteps the Intel iGPU D3D11 driver bug that crashed
AetherSDR during `QRhiWidget` reparenting (panadapter pop-out).

**Status-bar slice-locked toast (#2984)**

LOCKED feedback for blocked slice tuning surfaces as a status-bar
toast for 2 seconds. Centralised in `SliceModel` — previously each
tune-feedback site managed its own timer.

**TCI panadapter spectrum forwarding (#2841) + tx_gain + ALC (#2950)**

TCI server forwards panadapter FFT rows to subscribed clients (third-
party tools can render AetherSDR spectrum). New `tx_gain` command +
ALC reading exposed via `tx_sensors`.

**TCI TX overflow-mode picker (#3065)**

Right-click the TCI TX slider to choose how out-of-range (>1.0)
samples from digital-mode clients are handled before the radio sees
them: **Clip** (saturating ±1.0, legacy default), **NaNGuard** (pass
through bit-exact; only zero NaN/Inf), or **Measure** (true bypass —
count overshoots for telemetry, never mutate samples). WSJT-X / FT8
operators chasing bit-exact tone fidelity can drop the float-domain
limiter entirely. Default stays Clip so existing users see no
behavior change.

**AetherControl virtual FlexControl controller (#2888)**

Software-only FlexControl panel mirrors the physical USB knob layout.
Settings → FlexControl.

**Adaptive frame-rate throttle + graceful reconnect (#2829)**

Network-congestion-adaptive panadapter FPS throttle; reconnect
semantics that don't drop slice state on transient TLS drops.

**Mute-all-slices + reconnect mute fix (#2833)**

Master mute button in the RX panel; fixes stale mute display when
reconnecting to a radio.

**Spectrum Ctrl+wheel zoom anchored on cursor (#1518 / #2869)**

Ctrl+wheel zoom now centres on the cursor frequency rather than the
visible centre, matching common spectrum-analyser UX.

**multiFLEX dashboard disconnect controls (#2981)**

Per-client disconnect buttons in the multiFLEX dashboard.

**MQTT settings dialog refactor (#3051 — @s53zo)**

Substantial community PR that moves MQTT configuration out of the live
applet into a dedicated **Settings → MQTT…** dialog. The applet stays
as the live surface (connect/disconnect, status, message log, publish
buttons); the dialog owns broker credentials, TLS/CA config,
subscription rows, display-on-panadapter flags, and publish button
definitions. Persists the On/Off state as `MqttEnabled` for auto-
reconnect on startup. Also self-found and fixed a subscription-state
bug where removed topics could survive across reconnects.

Maintainer follow-up commits on top of the PR (subscribe-diff
optimisation; consolidation of the 8 MQTT flat AppSettings keys into a
single nested `MqttSettings` JSON block per Principle V, with one-shot
transparent migration from legacy keys).

**Loop antenna controls (#2863)**

Antenna A/B loop selection exposed via the RX panel.

**MQTT antenna display names (#2881)**

MQTT-driven antenna name overrides; pairs with the existing antenna-
alias store for radio-side identification.

**Cycle TX slice shortcut (#2836)**

New `cycle_tx_slice` action assignable to FlexControl, MIDI, or
keyboard.

**Drag value popups on sliders (#2944)**

All sliders show a value popup during drag, dismissing on release.

**Audio device prompt suppression (#2926)**

Hotplug-prompt suppression controls when the current selection still
works.

**FlexControl new wheel mode WheelAgcT (#2907)**

New wheel-mode action driving the AGC threshold slider, joining the
existing volume/AF/RIT/XIT modes.

**FlexControl master volume routing (#2925)**

FlexControl volume action now routes to master volume instead of the
active slice volume — matches operator expectation across most setups.

**ATU SWR sweep respects active band plan (#2800)**

The SWR sweep now restricts its scan to band-plan segments instead of
sweeping the full radio frequency range.

### Bug fixes — audio

- **Silent SSB/voice TX on macOS** (#2930) — mic native rate vs Qt
  request mismatch caused capture stream to deliver no frames. Fixed
  by honouring the mic's native rate and explicitly starting capture
  for `remote_audio_tx` mode.
- **CW sidetone routes to selected output** (#2899) — was routed to
  the default audio output regardless of the user's selection. Fixed
  via the same `AudioEngine` sink path as RX audio.
- **Windows COM port handle release** (#3010) — FlexControl USB
  serial port stayed open across application restart, blocking
  subsequent connections. Synchronous close on shutdown releases the
  handle.
- **TX final limiter default-off** (#3004) — client TX final limiter
  was on by default, dropping AetherSDR's drive level below SmartSDR's.
  Now off-by-default to match the parity expectation.
- **RN2 (RNNoise) on Tube Pre-Amp TX** (#2813) — Channel strip Tube
  Pre-Amp section gains an RN2 toggle for client-side TX noise
  reduction in addition to the existing RX RN2.
- **BYPASS persistence** (#2892) — Channel strip BYPASS state now
  persisted across application restart via the section-active flag.
- **mute_local_audio_when_remote restored** (#1110) — behaviour
  inadvertently removed in a v0.9.x refactor.
- **Hotplug dialog suppression** (#2864) — Linux audio hotplug dialog
  spammed users when an unrelated device appeared. Suppress when the
  currently-selected device is still available.
- **RADE state restoration on engine failure** (#2898, #2861) — slice
  state fully restores when the RADE engine fails to start.
- **FreeDV mode-string coverage** (#2820) — extended `FDVU`/`FDVL`
  checks to all RADE-related code paths.
- **Default audio summary logging** (#2973) — startup logs the
  active sinks / sources / resampler so support bundles surface the
  audio path without operator instrumentation.
- **RX audio stream diagnostics** (#2889) — per-stream RX diagnostics
  exposed in the support bundle.

### Bug fixes — spectrum + waterfall

- **TX waterfall stability across slices** (#3019) — TX waterfall on
  multi-pan setups had inconsistent row cadence and dBm range jitter.
  Fixed by computing TX waterfall mask from active TX filter +
  carrier, applying mask to all overlapping pans, and freezing dBm
  range during TX.
- **Panadapter center clamp** (#783 → #2867) — 7-year-old bug:
  panadapter centre could be set below 0 Hz when zooming aggressively.
  Clamped to non-negative.
- **Off-screen slice indicator comfort margin** (#2941) — single click
  on the chevron now reveals the slice 18% inside the visible band
  rather than landing on the edge.
- **Right-side applet clipping** (#3023) — applet content was clipped
  on the right when the applet panel scrollbar was visible. Adjusted
  viewport width.
- **FDX indicator ignores radio rejection** (#3016) — FDX showed
  enabled when the radio actually rejected the command. UI now
  downstream of authoritative radio state.
- **FFT line slider on QPainter path** (#2722) — FFT line height
  slider was honoured on the GPU path but ignored on the software-
  render path.
- **Native 4m/2m band selection** (#2831) — 4m + 2m bands route to
  the radio's native band selector via `ModelCapabilities` instead of
  the legacy `model.contains()` checks.
- **TXDSP drag silent-fail** (#1836 → #3044, #3058) — composite tile
  didn't reorder via drag because its internal container id (`tx_dsp`)
  differed from its `AppletEntry.id` (`TXDSP`). First fix landed an
  aliasing fallback in `dropEvent` (#3044); cleanup PR introduced
  `ContainerWidget::setDragId()` so the composite explicitly sets the
  drag identity, eliminating the fallback (#3058).
- **XVTR validity guard for waterfall remapping** (#2853) —
  regression fix from earlier waterfall work.

### Bug fixes — CAT, protocol, MIDI

- **TCI use-after-free in queued lambdas** (#2814) — `TciProtocol`
  could be destroyed while queued lambdas held a raw pointer.
  Captured by `QPointer`.
- **RigctlProtocol use-after-free in queued lambdas** (#2995) — same
  pattern, different file.
- **set_split_vfo TX slice ping-pong** (#2931) — rigctld
  `set_split_vfo` poll could ping-pong TX between slices.
- **rigctld cwx routing through CwxModel** (#2909) — `cwx send`/clear
  now produce CAT sidetone consistent with manual keyer input.
- **MIDI VFO encoder direction + step size** (#2993) — binary VFO
  encoder direction was inverted; step size now reads from the
  encoder's actual config, not the slice's default.
- **MIDI tx.mox uses isTransmitting** (#2859) — toggle now reads
  `isTransmitting()` not `isMox()`, avoiding feedback loops on QSK or
  hardware-keyed PTT.
- **TCI emit vfo after band-change slice recreate** (#2828) — TCI
  clients weren't notified of the new VFO frequency after a band-
  change forced slice recreation.
- **HID IcomRC28Parser byte offsets** (#1896) — 7-year-old bug:
  parser had wrong byte offsets and report-size assumption.
- **NRS level re-push after profile global recall** (#2849) — slice
  state cache wasn't replayed for radio-default-on settings.
- **Slice state cached and replayed for profile recall** (#2917) —
  re-pushes cached NRS / NB / etc. after a profile global recall.

### Bug fixes — UI & UX

- **Single-click discrimination interval setting** (#3009) — exposed
  the single-vs-double-click discrimination interval as a user
  setting; old hardcoded 230 ms was too short for slower-tap operators.
- **Slice-mute UI consolidation** (#3006) — single-click mutes this
  slice; double-click mutes all slices.
- **WheelMasterAf consolidated into WheelVolume** (#2986) — two
  near-identical FlexControl wheel modes folded.
- **Radio Setup microphone control alignment** (#3008) — visual
  cleanup of the mic config row.
- **GuardedSlider type tightening + EQ formatter extraction** (#2987)
- **About dialog: hoist AETHER_GIT_SHA fallback + CMake clarity**
  (#2991, #2988)
- **What's New dialog refactor** (#2979) + WhatsNew generator cleanup
  (#2992)
- **Background image dialog parented to top-level** (#2865)
- **VFO `QStackedWidget` cross-tab height inflation** (#2821)
- **Suppress routine connect notices during startup** (#2852)
- **Suppress interlock error dialogs** (#2851) — these were noise
  during normal TX handovers.
- **WaveApplet drawer collapsed state persistence** (#2827)
- **Applet panel float / dock title-bar icon sync** (#2896)
- **Antenna SWR sweep respects active band plan** (#2800)
- **Drag value popups during slider drag** (#2944)
- **Clipboard copy controls in Radio Setup details** (#2976)
- **Native 4m/2m band selection routing** (#2831)
- **Sync RX antenna status to panadapter** (#2862) + **sync WNB
  status from radio** (#2860)

### Bug fixes — security

- **PII log redactor regex tightening** (#2954)
- **Read-buffer caps on radio/WAN/DxCluster sockets** (#2955)
- **Callsign sanitisation in WAV recording paths** (#2956) —
  callsigns containing `/` (e.g. `/M`, `/P`, `/MM`) could escape the
  WAV recording directory.
- **Atomic-rename log symlink** (#2957) — was remove + symlink, brief
  window where the symlink didn't exist.

### Refactor & internals

- **LOCKED tune-feedback timer centralization** (#2983 → #3017) —
  per-site timers consolidated into `SliceModel`.
- **Band-plan contiguous-regions walker** (#2822 → #3018) — single
  canonical walker for ATU pre-tune + SWR sweep.
- **Canonical Biquad utility** (#3042 → #3045) — new
  `src/core/Biquad.{h,cpp}` + `StereoBiquad` with 9 filter types
  (LowPass / HighPass / BandPassConstQ / BandPassPeak / Notch /
  AllPass / PeakingEq / LowShelf / HighShelf), DF-II Transposed
  topology, double-coeffs + float-state precision split.
  Migration of the 5+ scattered biquad implementations
  (DESS / Pudu / PhaseRotator / Eq) to follow in subsequent PRs.
- **`ContainerWidget::dragId`** (#3057 → #3058) — optional drag-
  identity property separates "drag MIME identity" from "container
  persistence identity". Composite tiles (TXDSP) can set `dragId`
  without renaming their persisted `m_id`.
- **`RadioModel::m_pendingPanStatuses` TTL** (#2228 → #3037) — 30 s
  TTL sweep on insert bounds the deferred-pan-status map for
  never-claimed pans.
- **AetherSweep decouple from `m_overlayMenu`** (#2205 → #3035) —
  `leftOccludedRect()` helper abstracts overlay-menu geometry queries.
- **Comfort margin ternary cleanup** (#3033 → #3039) — collapsed
  redundant branches after #3030 made the `revealOffscreen` and
  default arms return identical values.
- **Dead FFT accumulator state cleanup** (#3038 → #3040) — removed
  five unused members after #3031's debt-gate removal.
- **CODEOWNERS framework + teams** (#3053, #3055) — three-tier
  CODEOWNERS with team mentions (`@aethersdr/maintainers`,
  `@aethersdr/infrastructure`, `@aethersdr/reviewers`) replacing
  per-user ownership. Tier 1 = governance/security/bot policy,
  Tier 2 = infrastructure, Tier 3 = source code.
- **liquid-dsp vendored** (#3043 → #3046) — comprehensive DSP toolkit
  (modems / FEC / adaptive filters / AGC / NCO) vendored at
  `third_party/liquid-dsp/`. Built static, linked into AetherSDR on
  Linux + macOS. MSVC build skipped due to C99 `_Complex` syntax
  incompatibility (tracked separately as #3049).

### Diagnostics & support bundles

- **TX route diagnostics in support bundle** (#2885 → #2919) —
  support-bundle `tx_route` section surfaces TX slice id / mode /
  DAX channel.
- **About dialog git short SHA** (#2988) — surfaces git short SHA
  under the version line.
- **What's New dialog refactor** (#2979) — UX overhaul of the
  release-notes browser.

### Build & CI

- **`check-windows` path filter for MainWindow.{cpp,h}** (#2671 →
  #3028) — file is densely guarded with `#ifdef Q_OS_WIN` and was
  previously the source of most MSVC-only regressions. Triggers
  Windows CI on changes to it now.
- **Weekly ASan / UBSan / TSan workflow** (#2866) — weekly sanitizer
  build with sticky-issue tracking.
- **Pin all third-party action references by commit SHA** (#2920)
- **Auto-pin docker image digest** (#2918) — ci.yml and codeql.yml.
- **Least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN` scopes** (#2916) — ci.yml and
  codeql.yml drop default token scopes; jobs that need more opt in
  explicitly.
- **CODEOWNERS @jensenpat scope expansion** (#2915) — landed
  pre-#3053 framework refactor.
- Multiple dependabot bumps (#2996–#3000, #2922) — docker actions,
  ccache-action, sccache-action, github-script, ws npm dep in the
  Stream Deck plugin.

### Documentation

- **Restructure `docs/`** (#2963) — split into `architecture/`,
  `style/`, `qa/` subdirectories + `tests/README`. No content lost,
  just structure.
- **Community-response style guide** (#2966) — added to
  `.specify/memory/` for AetherClaude orchestrator + maintainer use.

## [v26.5.2.1] — 2026-05-17

### Hotfix — TCI TX audio level, Windows process-hang, SSA Sweden band plan, AppImage build

Three bug fixes plus one community contribution shipped within a day of
v26.5.2.  Recommended upgrade for any operator using TCI digital modes
(WSJT-X / JTDX), Windows users with MQTT or floating-panel windows, and
Linux operators building from source on Ubuntu 22.04.

### Bug fixes

**TCI TX audio level regression vs v26.5.1 (#2806)**
- v26.5.2's TCI server identity (`device:SunSDR2DX` + `protocol:ExpertSDR2,1.9`,
  added in #2597 for RF2K-S amplifier whitelist compatibility) hit a
  specific code path in WSJT-X's `TCITransceiver`
  (`TCITransceiver.cpp:823` + `.hpp:188-200`) that halves outgoing TX
  sample amplitude (K2 = 0.499 / 0x7FFF vs K1 = 0.999 / 0x7FFF, ~-6 dB
  at the source) when **both** of these match:
  - `device:` is `"SunSDR2DX"` or `"SunSDR2PRO"`
  - `protocol:` is not `"ExpertSDR3"`
- Operators measured ~70 W of 100 W expected on a 100 W slice.
- Fix changes identity to `device:AetherSDR` + `protocol:ExpertSDR3,1.5`,
  which clears **both** triggers (belt-and-suspenders) and selects
  WSJT-X command formats that AetherSDR has supported correctly since
  v26.5.1.  Side benefit: the literal `device:AetherSDR` avoids the
  leading-space parser trip the older `<name> <model>` form caused
  when a radio nickname was empty.
- Everything else from #2597 (strict init-burst order, `vfo_limits`,
  `if_limits`, `channels_count`, `split_enable`, post-READY audio
  stream configuration) is preserved — that's the bulk of what the
  RF2K-S TCI parser actually keys on to engage.  Configurable /
  per-client adaptive identity to restore the SunSDR2DX whitelist
  half is tracked in #2806.

**Windows process lingering in Task Manager after close (#2802, chibondking)**
- Three independent root causes ganged up to keep `AetherSDR.exe`
  visible in Task Manager indefinitely after the main window closed.
  Each ships a minimal one-line fix matching an existing precedent:
  - `m_aetherialStrip` carries `Qt::Window` for an independent taskbar
    entry; Qt 6 treats that as top-level for `quitOnLastWindowClosed`,
    and the default `WA_QuitOnClose = true` blocked the quit signal.
    Now sets `WA_QuitOnClose = false` immediately after the window-flag
    is applied.
  - `m_appletPanelFloatWindow` is constructed `parent = nullptr` (a
    real top-level) and was the only top-level secondary window in the
    codebase missing `WA_QuitOnClose = false`.  `FloatingContainerWindow`
    has set the same attribute since the frameless popout work.
  - `MqttClient::~MqttClient` called `mosquitto_destroy()` on Windows
    without ever stopping the loop thread (the existing `#ifndef Q_OS_WIN`
    guard in `disconnect()` skipped `loop_stop` to avoid a deadlock).
    libmosquitto's contract requires `loop_stop` before `destroy`; the
    destructor now calls `mosquitto_loop_stop(m_mosq, true)` (`force=true`,
    can't deadlock) — the same pattern `connectToBroker()` already used.
- Result: process exits within ~1 s of main-window close, every time.

**Linux AppImage build failure on gcc 11 strict mode (#2799)**
- `third_party/libmodem_core/bitstream.h:192` used unqualified `container`
  inside the `noexcept(noexcept(...))` clause of a class template member.
  gcc 11.4 (Ubuntu 22.04 native runner used by the AppImage workflow)
  requires `this->container` for two-phase name lookup of class-template
  member access from inside a function-signature noexcept clause.  Newer
  gcc (Docker CI image) was lenient; AppImage CI bombed on the v26.5.2
  tag push.
- Fix qualifies both references with `this->` — pure portability,
  zero user-visible change.  Restored the v26.5.2 AppImage x86_64
  artifact via `workflow_dispatch` after the fix landed.

### New region data

**SSA (Sweden) band plan (#2805, NF0T)**
- Adds `resources/bandplans/ssa-sweden.json` — Swedish national overlay
  on IARU Region 1 with the correct 6 m band edge (50–52 MHz, not the
  IARU R1 file's 50–54 MHz), embedded power-limit suffixes on bands
  where PTSFS 2025:1 imposes substantially lower caps (60 m 15 W e.i.r.p.,
  30 m 150 W p.e.p.), Swedish segment labels (ALLA, FYRAR, SMAL DIGI),
  and finer 6 m segmentation matching SSA's published v3.0 plan
  (separate beacon-only 50.400–50.500 segment, FM/DV repeater input
  51.210–51.390, output 51.810–51.990).  89 Swedish-language activity-
  center / digital / beacon / emergency spots.
- Auto-loaded by `BandPlanManager::loadPlans()`, surfaced in
  View → Band Plan submenu.  Principle IV — no hardcoded Swedish edges
  in C++.

### Contributors

Thanks to **@chibondking** for the Windows process-hang root-cause
analysis and triple-fix (#2802); **@NF0T** for the SSA Sweden band plan
on top of an already-busy week of FreeDV/RADE work (#2805); and
**@jensenpat** for the third_party libmodem_core code that landed in
#2753 (and whose portability tweak is in this hotfix).

## [v26.5.2] — 2026-05-17

### Six days of community momentum — AetherModem, FreeDV ergonomics, FLEX-6700 4m/2m, dialog architecture sweep

The first natural-cadence release after the 1.0-equivalent. **123 commits in
six days**, driven by an unusually active week from community contributors and
the AetherClaude orchestrator. Highlights:

- **AetherModem** — Phase-0 bring-up of a native AX.25 packet decoder
  (`jensenpat`), with 21-lane phase-bank HDLC framing, FCS validation, and a
  new Packet Decode dialog. RX is active on 300 baud HF and 1200 baud VHF;
  TX is live on 300 baud HF with timing refinements queued for Phase 1.
- **FreeDV/RADE ergonomics** — sync/SNR indicator in the VFO widget for FDVU/FDVL
  slices, far-end callsign and frequency-offset row, end-of-over (EOO) callsign
  decode + FreeDV Reporter posting (`NF0T`).
- **FLEX-6500 / FLEX-6700 4m/2m bands** — surfaced via `ModelCapabilities`
  using FlexLib `ModelInfo.cs` as the authority; works with the radio's
  internal XVTR or any external transverter.
- **PersistentDialog architecture sweep** — new base class + showOrRaisePersistent
  pattern; 10+ dialogs migrated (Profile Manager, Profile Import/Export, Memory,
  Network Diagnostics, PropDashboard, TxBand, Waveforms, RadioSetup, DxCluster,
  AetherDsp, AX.25 Packet Decoder, MIDI, MQTT, SpotHub). Frameless toggle now
  propagates correctly; geometry persists; no duplicate-window classes of bug.
- **Spectrum & panadapter stabilization** (`rfoust`) — panadapter restore-on-
  reconnect across multi-pan and floating-pan setups, macOS GPU lifecycle
  cleanup, dBm-range echo smoothing (no snap-back after release), Ctrl-drag
  dBm zoom, Ctrl-drag waterfall rate.
- **Protocol hardening** — `M`-message severity parsing (no more Info notices
  popping modals), hex meter num field handling, `tx_slice_mode` from transmit
  status, FlexWaveformModel for firmware v4.2.18 WFP status.

Huge thanks to **@jensenpat** (AetherModem Phase-0, AX.25 timing, AX.25 receive
improvements, FFT floor lock edge cases, XVTR waterfall offset, RF Gain / AGC-T
shortcuts, spot auto-mode routing), **@NF0T / Ryan** (FreeDV sync indicator,
Waveforms dialog, FlexWaveformModel protocol, hex meter parser, CWX context
menu + CharGap, RADE auto-deactivate, tx_slice_mode, RX-applet radeActivated
restore), **@rfoust / Robbie** (panadapter persistence + macOS GPU lifecycle,
dBm Ctrl-zoom, ctrl-drag waterfall rate, TNF status tooltip, panadapter
restore-window extension, spectrum dBm echo smoothing, FFT floor edge cases),
**@M7HNF-Ian** (spot tooltips near waterfall edge, SpotHub auto-reconnect),
**@algojogacor** (spot label gap), and **@aethersdr-agent** (AetherClaude — 30+
mechanical fixes including the entire PersistentDialog migration sweep, persistence
fixes, log rotation, naming polish, AsyncLogWriter + PerfTelemetry test harnesses,
NoiseFloor diagnostics).

### New features

**AetherModem — AX.25 packet decoder (Phase 0, #2753, jensenpat)**
- Native HDLC/AX.25 packet decoder integrated into the slice signal path.
  21-lane phase-bank receiver with FCS validation. New `Packet Decoder`
  dialog accessible from the slice context menu; tagged as Experimental
  via banner (#2764) until 1200 baud VHF reaches feature parity with HF.
- Receive timing improved in follow-on PR #2788; em-dash render fix on
  the experimental banner (#2791).

**AetherModem Phase-0 indicator on Packet Decoder dialog (#2766)**
- Surfaces the Experimental status with a dedicated banner so operators
  understand TX coverage (HF 300 baud only) vs RX coverage (HF 300 +
  VHF 1200).

**FreeDV/RADE sync + SNR indicator in VFO widget (#2776, NF0T)**
- New VFO widget chrome on FDVU/FDVL slices: shows sync state and
  decoded SNR alongside the standard frequency / mode / filter display.

**RADE info row — far-end callsign, SNR, freq offset (#2660)**
- Per-slice RADE info row exposing the far-end's callsign, decoded SNR,
  and frequency offset for live awareness during a QSO.

**RADE EOO callsign decode + FreeDV Reporter posting (#2659)**
- Decodes the end-of-over callsign from the far end and posts it to
  FreeDV Reporter for spotting / heard-list integration.

**FlexWaveformModel for firmware v4.2.18 waveform status (#2759, NF0T)**
- New `FlexWaveformModel` parses `waveform` status objects from firmware
  v4.2.18 and surfaces them in a dedicated Waveforms dialog (#2779) under
  File menu for WFP status and per-waveform management.

**4m / 2m bands on FLEX-6500 and FLEX-6700 (#2757)**
- Surfaces 4 m and 2 m band buttons on FLEX-6500 / FLEX-6700 via
  `ModelCapabilities`. Reads the per-model XVTR allocation from FlexLib
  `ModelInfo.cs` (authoritative source) and routes click-to-band through
  the existing XVTR slice creation path.

**Smart Spot Filtering — dim unmatched DX voice spots (#2555)**
- New SpotHub filter that dims/hides DX voice spots that don't match a
  user-defined pattern (country/zone/mode). Companion to the existing
  callsign-pattern filter; user-configurable match window in #2699.

**Auto-squelch with 3-way SQL cycle (#2544)**
- New tri-state squelch toggle: Off → SQL (manual) → Auto (tracks the
  noise floor). Cycles via the SQL button or the keyboard shortcut.

**Local antenna display names (#2620)**
- Per-radio antenna labels (e.g. "ANT1 → 80m Dipole") stored
  client-side and applied across slice context menus, RX applet, and
  TX band dialog. Radio still uses ANT1/ANT2/RX-A for the wire protocol.

**ATU band pre-tune sweep + clear memories (#2630)**
- New ATU action: sweep the active band in 20 kHz steps and pre-tune
  every segment, building a band-wide ATU memory table in one pass.
  Plus a per-band Clear Memories action.

**License confirmation modal for Antenna SWR Sweep (#2691)**
- Adds a one-time license-acknowledgement modal before allowing
  Antenna SWR Sweep — clarifies that the sweep transmits.

**Numeric entry for Aetherial Audio effect parameters (#2697)**
- All Aetherial Audio Channel Strip knobs now support direct numeric
  entry alongside drag-to-set.

**FlexRadio profile import/export via .ssdr_cfg (#2641)**
- Import and export TX / Mic / Global profiles in FlexRadio's
  `.ssdr_cfg` wire format. Round-trip compatible with SmartSDR; lets
  operators migrate profile libraries from Windows to Linux/macOS.

**FlexControl CWX F1-F12 macro actions (#2725)**
- The FlexControl USB knob can now trigger CWX (and DVK) F-key macros
  via button mappings.

**Independent RX/TX CW decode toggles (#2638)**
- RX-side and TX-side CW decode can be enabled independently; previously
  toggled together.

**Auto-Save inline when TX/Mic profile name collides (#2790, #2712)**
- The profile-save warning dialog now offers Auto-Save as an inline
  option rather than requiring a separate menu trip.

**Persist TX Tune Mode + EQ applet RX/TX view (#2735, #2736)**
- Tune Mode (single-tone vs two-tone) and the EQ applet's RX/TX
  selection persist across launches. Note: TX Tune Mode persistence
  was subsequently reverted to a right-click menu in #2787 to avoid
  the connect-time re-apply trap; the right-click stays.

**Two-tone TUNE selector via right-click (#2787)**
- TUNE button right-click exposes Mono Tone / Two Tone selection;
  cleaner than the persisted-setting form.

**TNF status tooltip (#2789)**
- Hovering a TNF marker now shows depth/permanent state inline.

**Audio device hotplug + notification dialog (#2583)**
- Detects audio device add/remove events from the OS and routes the
  current PC audio path through the change with a notification dialog
  so the user can choose to follow the new default or stay.

**PEP peak-hold tick on TX FWDPWR gauge (#2596)**
- Adds the canonical PEP peak-hold tick (with configurable hold time)
  to the FWDPWR meter, matching SmartSDR's PEP display semantics.

**Profile Manager non-modal + persist geometry (#2591)**
- Profile Manager dialog migrated to the PersistentDialog base class —
  non-modal, geometry persists, frameless chrome support.

**Ctrl-drag waterfall rate control (#2783)**
- Holding Ctrl while dragging the waterfall vertically adjusts the
  scroll rate (50 ms – 500 ms per line).

**Ctrl-drag dBm scale zoom (#2717, #2726)**
- Holding Ctrl while dragging the dBm scale zooms vertical range
  symmetrically; tooltip and help docs (#2726) document the gesture.

**Pan-follow-VFO triggers off flag outer edge (#2784, #2761)**
- When a VFO flag approaches the panadapter edge, pan-follow now
  triggers off the outer edge of the flag rather than the center —
  no more cropped flags when the user pans to track a signal.

**Spectrum overlay Display panel reorder + SQL Margin → RX Applet (#2695)**
- Display panel controls reordered for clarity; SQL Margin moved from
  the spectrum overlay to the RX applet where it belongs.

**Audio Device Detected dialog gets frameless chrome (#2618)**
- Standard 18 px gradient title bar + chrome treatment, matching the
  rest of the app.

**Floor: auto-adjust — asymmetric smoothing + transient rejection (#2653)**
- The Floor: auto-adjust algorithm now uses asymmetric smoothing
  (fast attack on rising floor, slow release on falling) and rejects
  transient peaks. Replaces the old zoom-based response with a pan-only
  response so signal heights stay visually stable as the floor moves.

**Radio-letter slice display mode for Multi-Flex (#2606, #2708)**
- New display mode shows radio-side slice identifier (A/B/C/D) instead
  of client-local letter for Multi-Flex sessions where multiple clients
  may have different letter assignments.

**Network audio packet-loss concealment (#2732)**
- PLC algorithm fills brief network audio dropouts (1–3 packets) with
  spectrally-matched filler instead of silence; eliminates audible
  pops on lossy Wi-Fi.

**Lock split-pair VFO panels to opposite sides (#2744, #2663)**
- Split-pair VFOs (A/B in split mode) now lock to opposite sides of
  the dual-VFO layout to prevent operator confusion.

**Right-click context menu on CWX history bubbles (#2752)**
- CWX history bubbles get a right-click context menu for delete /
  resend / edit actions.

**Cluster overflow popup emits spotTriggered (#2741)**
- Clicking a spot inside the cluster overflow popup now triggers the
  full `spotTriggered` flow (slice retune + spot record), not just
  the bare frequency move.

**RF Gain and AGC-T keyboard shortcuts (#2710, jensenpat)**
- Adds `rf_gain_up/down` and `agc_t_up/down` shortcut actions for
  keyboard and FlexControl mapping.

**Interlock notification system (#2586)**
- Per-band interlock state changes (band-cancel, amp-warmup, ATU-busy)
  now route through a unified notification system rather than ad-hoc
  modal popups.

**Smart Spot Filter match window (#2699)**
- User-configurable time window for the Smart Spot Filter — controls
  how long a matched spot's marker remains highlighted.

### Bug fixes

**Spectrum dBm range echo smoothing (#2793, rfoust)**
- After releasing a dBm scale drag, in-flight FFT frames encoded for
  the old range no longer snap the trace back. Rebases up to 10 frames
  with a 0.75 dB median-improvement guard. Also splits auto-floor echo
  handling from manual drag echo so the smooth animation no longer
  steps when the radio is slow to ack.

**Panadapter layout / floating persistence + macOS GPU lifecycle (#2786, #2780, rfoust)**
- Panadapter layout state restores cleanly on radio reconnect across
  multi-pan and floating-pan window configurations. Bundles the macOS
  QRhi GPU lifecycle fix (reparenting on dock/float and clean shutdown).

**Extend panadapter startup layout restore window (#2792, rfoust)**
- Restore window widened from 5 s to 30 s for slow reconnects, with a
  user-intent suppress flag so layout-button presses during the wider
  window don't get clobbered.

**Spectrum FFT line width slider produces visible pixel-width line (#2706)**
- Slider value previously produced sub-pixel-width strokes on some
  scale factors. Now floor-rounded to an integer pixel width before
  draw.

**M-message severity respected so Info notices don't pop modals (#2785)**
- The radio's M-message severity bits (Info / Notice / Warning / Error)
  were previously ignored; Info-level messages popped error modals.
  Now routed to the status bar for Info/Notice and the modal only for
  Warning/Error.

**Parse hex meter num field + handle M-prefix radio messages (#2771, NF0T)**
- Meter-number field was decimal-only, breaking on radios that send
  hex. Plus the `M`-prefix radio message form is now parsed correctly.

**Panadapter vanished panstack on left-dock startup (#2733, #2704)**
- Empty panstack on first launch when the applet panel was left-docked.
  Two related size-setter bugs (#2746 follow-up) addressed.

**XVTR waterfall offset matching (#2709, jensenpat)**
- Waterfall display offset for XVTR slices now matches the spectrum
  offset on unvalidated profile entries.

**Spot auto-mode slice routing (#2713, jensenpat)**
- Auto-mode spots now route to the correct slice based on
  mode-compatibility rather than always-slice-0.

**Spot tooltips disappearing near waterfall edge (#2740, M7HNF-Ian)**
- Tooltips clipped past the waterfall edge are now anchored above the
  cursor.

**FFT floor lock edge cases (#2715, rfoust)**
- Edge-case crashes in the FFT-floor-lock state machine resolved.

**XVTR direct-entry tuning above 450 MHz (#2621)**
- Direct frequency entry on XVTR slices accepted values above 450 MHz
  in display but the slice tune command rejected. Now passes through.

**Spot tooltip cursor offset + re-anchor suppression (#2631, #2654)**
- DX / band-plan tooltips offset from the cursor to avoid covering
  the spot label; suppresses re-anchor flicker during slow mouse moves.

**Spot label gap in spectrum (#2702, algojogacor)**
- Inter-label spacing now enforced so adjacent spot labels don't
  overlap.

**TX/Mic Save button silently no-ops on existing names (#2707, #2637)**
- Profile Save with an existing name now shows a confirm dialog
  instead of failing silently.

**Layout: second size-setter also clobbered left-dock startup (#2746)**
- Follow-up to #2733; a second size-setter path was also clobbering
  the left-dock layout.

**Restore WAVE TX scope for digital audio (#2688)**
- Digital-mode TX (DIGU/DIGL/FT8/RTTY) now restores the WAVE-TX scope
  selection on reconnect.

**RADE auto-deactivate when slice mode changes externally (#2747, NF0T)**
- When the radio (or another client) changes a RADE slice to a non-
  RADE mode, RADE now auto-deactivates client-side.

**Restore unconditional radeActivated(false) emit on RX applet (#2745, NF0T)**
- RX applet's RADE state emit was elided in some teardown paths,
  leaving downstream consumers stale.

**CharGap between live-mode Pending entries in CwxLocalKeyer (#2754, NF0T)**
- Successive Pending entries in the CWX live-mode buffer were
  concatenated without the inter-character gap.

**Suppress amp/tuner popup during normal TX (#2678)**
- Interlock notification popup was firing during normal TX engagement.
  Now gated on `tx_allowed` to fire only when the interlock actually
  blocks TX.

**ATU walk segment list per discrete-channel band (#2686)**
- ATU sweep was sampling continuous-band centers on discrete-channel
  bands (60 m). Now walks the segment list instead.

**wasVisible-guard on remaining setGeometry sites (#2685, #2635)**
- Four (plus three) more frameless-toggle setGeometry sites adopted
  the wasVisible-guard pattern to avoid first-show off-screen positions.

**SQL threshold line auto-hide restored (#2684)**
- Manual SQL threshold line auto-hides after 3 s of inactivity again.

**Waterfall pace TX/FFT-fallback rows to radio line_duration (#2667)**
- During TX or FFT-fallback, the waterfall now paces row insertion to
  the radio's reported `line_duration` instead of free-running.

**Spot dedup cluster echo of manually-posted spot (#2661)**
- A manually-posted spot is no longer re-displayed when the cluster
  echoes it back.

**Profile Manager 'next tab' wording (#2729)**
- Wording clarified from ambiguous "next" to specific tab name.

**TX timeout display in seconds, not milliseconds (#2642)**
- TX timeout indicator was showing milliseconds with a "s" unit.

**Tear down float window when dock-side icon clicked (#2673)**
- Re-docking a float window via the dock-side icon now tears down the
  float window cleanly.

**CW Int16 fallback for sidetone sink on Int16-only WASAPI devices (#2668)**
- CW sidetone now falls back to Int16 on WASAPI devices that don't
  support float32.

**Don't toggle radio dax flag on Windows from slice-mode changes (#2670, #2315)**
- Windows slice-mode-change side-effect that toggled the radio's
  DAX flag eliminated.

**Guard m_daxBridge ref in deactivateRADE() (#2662)**
- Null-guards added to the RADE deactivation path for Windows / no-
  PipeWire builds.

**RADE DAX stream lifecycle on macOS (#2633)**
- RADE DAX stream lifecycle on macOS now matches Linux/Windows
  behavior.

**macOS Bluetooth headset mic capture rate (#2615)**
- macOS Bluetooth headset mic capture now correctly negotiates the
  supported rate (was hardcoded to 48 kHz, breaking 16 kHz BT codecs).

**S-History voice signal carrier detection (#2549)**
- Voice signal carrier frequency detection improved — handles slightly
  off-tune voice signals.

**Dx-cluster strip non-printable control chars (#2700)**
- Cluster console lines now have control characters stripped before
  display.

**TCI spec/impl compliance + RF2K-S amplifier interop (#2597)**
- Several TCI v2.0 command spec divergences corrected; RF2K-S
  amplifier now interoperates correctly via TCI.

**Prevent remote_audio_rx stream on TCI autostart if PC audio disabled (#2557, #1137)**
- TCI autostart no longer creates a remote_audio_rx stream when PC
  audio is disabled in settings.

**Make set_split_vfo / tx_enable idempotent to stop radio TX watchdog (#2568)**
- These two CAT commands now idempotent — repeated state-equal calls
  no longer trip the radio's TX watchdog.

**Drive CWX/DVK F1-F12 shortcuts by active slice mode (#2590, #2582)**
- F-key shortcut routing now respects the active slice's mode.

**Frameless title bar drag on macOS (#2576)**
- macOS frameless title bar drag now uses the native window-drag API
  instead of synthetic mouse events.

**FPS meter overlay redraw stutter (#2578)**
- FPS meter overlay was redrawing every frame; now diff-gated.

**HID automoc source registration (#2577)**
- HID source files now correctly registered with automoc.

**macOS iconset 512@2x size (#2579)**
- macOS iconset 512@2x size corrected.

**TX mic stereo channel canonicalization (#2572)**
- Stereo mic channel order canonicalized to L=mic / R=mic across
  all platforms.

**Streamdeck tune-up/down step (#2714, #2409)**
- Streamdeck tune step bumped from 100 Hz to 1 kHz (matches main app
  step semantics).

**Consolidate duplicate aether.ax25 Q_LOGGING_CATEGORY (#2770, #2763)**
- The `aether.ax25` logging category was declared in two TUs; consolidated
  to a single declaration in `LogManager.cpp` with shared header access.

**dBm-scale Ctrl-drag zoom tooltip + help docs (#2726)**
- Companion to #2717; documents the gesture in tooltip + help.

**Log diagnostic when noise-floor capture bails (#2727, #2720)**
- New diagnostic log line when the noise-floor capture path returns
  early without producing a sample.

**ANT-tab slider default Qt border (#2751)**
- Restores the default Qt slider border on the ANT-tab sliders.

### Infrastructure

**PersistentDialog base class + showOrRaisePersistent migration sweep (#2644)**
- New `PersistentDialog` base class providing frameless-chrome support,
  geometry persistence, and lazy-construct/raise lifecycle via
  `showOrRaisePersistent<T>()`. Migrated dialogs include Profile Manager,
  Profile Import/Export, Memory, Network Diagnostics, PropDashboard,
  TxBand, Waveforms, RadioSetup (primary + 3 secondary entries), DxCluster,
  AetherDsp, AX.25 Packet Decoder, MIDI, MQTT, SpotHub. The migration
  closes a long list of legacy duplicate-window and frameless-toggle bugs.

**Migrate three secondary RadioSetupDialog entry points (#2795, #2781)**
- FlexControl, USB Cables, and XVTR overlay entry points now use
  `showOrRaisePersistent` and converge on the single tracked instance.
  Closes the duplicate-RadioSetup-window class of bug.

**Migrate seven dialogs to PersistentDialog (#2676)**
- Bulk migration of Memory, NetworkDiagnostics, AetherDsp, MIDI, MQTT,
  SpotHub, and AX.25 Packet Decoder dialogs to the new base class.

**Migrate PropDashboardDialog to PersistentDialog (#2775)**
- Companion to #2676.

**Extract TxBandDialog to its own class + migrate to PersistentDialog (#2774)**
- TxBandDialog extracted from MainWindow.cpp inline construction into
  its own class file + base-class migration.

**Log rotation + startup retention cap (#2765, #2498)**
- AsyncLogWriter now rotates the log file on size threshold and caps
  retained log files on startup.

**Unit tests for AsyncLogWriter (#2760, #2497)**
- New test harness for AsyncLogWriter rotation, buffering, and
  shutdown behavior.

**Unit tests for PerfTelemetry (#2782, #2500)**
- New test harness covering frame-time histogram, heartbeat capture,
  and aggregation.

**Lock IARU R1 reference table for computeCenters() (#2687, #2648)**
- New test guards the IARU R1 reference table used for ATU center
  computation.

**Make VirtualAudioBridge thread-safe for DAX RX DirectConnection (#2762, #2486)**
- Thread-safe accessors added to VirtualAudioBridge for the DAX RX
  DirectConnection path.

**CI post-merge guard + drop stale-branch pre-merge enforcement (#2749)**
- Adds a post-merge job that catches stale-snapshot reverts; removes
  the brittle pre-merge stale-branch check that was producing too many
  false positives.

**Refresh in-repo URLs to aethersdr/AetherSDR org (#2723)**
- Sweep across docs, CI workflows, and source comments to update the
  GitHub org reference following the org move from `ten9876` →
  `aethersdr` (2026-05-16).

**Bundle zlib 1.3.1 under third_party/ (#2698, #2651)**
- zlib now vendored to remove the system-dep variation across distros.

**Add spec-kit constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md (#2636)**
- Establishes the project's eight inviolable principles (FlexLib
  authority, MeterSmoother canonicality, UI-label-driven naming,
  region-aware band data, nested-JSON config, CHAIN-widget TX DSP
  entry, auto-generated Contributors list) as the authoritative
  reference for AI-agent contributions.

**Frameless guidance for popout dialogs in CLAUDE.md (#2619)**
- Documents the canonical frameless pattern for popout dialogs.

**Add frameless support for popout dialogs (#2580)**
- Foundational frameless chrome support for popout / floating
  dialogs (sets up the PersistentDialog work that followed).

**Document _tci._tcp.local mDNS discovery schema (#2613, #2502)**
- TCI mDNS discovery schema documented.

**Document AetherSDR audio pipeline (#2571)**
- New docs page covering the full audio pipeline (TX mic path, RX
  audio path, DAX, RADE, TCI, AetherModem).

**Drop dead SHistorySoftEdgeDb settings key (#2608, #2607)**
- Removes an unused settings key + saves a migration step.

**Add PC Audio device tooltip (#2587)**
- The PC Audio panel now shows a tooltip with the underlying device
  identifier on hover.

**Remove dead startSystemMove branch in ContainerWidget (#2645)**
- Dead-code cleanup.

**Remove dead drawFpsMeters() painter path (#2632, #2602)**
- Replaced by the overlay-based FPS meter from #2480.

**Add aethersdr-wallpaper.png to docs**
- Project wallpaper for marketing / community.

## [v26.5.1] — 2026-05-10

### 1.0 — first stable release; CalVer cutover

The 1.0-equivalent. After eight 0.9.x cycles the client now covers
every documented SmartSDR feature on the FLEX-6000, FLEX-8000, and
Aurora platforms, and ships the Aetherial Audio Channel Strip's RX and
TX paths in full. Confidence in stability across Linux / macOS /
Windows is high enough to drop the pre-1.0 framing.

Coincident with the milestone, the project switches from semver to
**CalVer** (`YY.M.patch`). Rationale: AetherSDR's release cadence is
driven by FlexLib protocol changes, ham contest seasons, and a steady
trickle of community fixes — not by API stability commitments to
downstream consumers. CalVer communicates "this is what shipped in
month X" more honestly than a 1.x semantic version would. The previous
`v0.9.x` tags remain in git history; new tags use the `vYY.M.patch`
form starting here.

55 commits since v0.9.8; highlights below. Big thanks to **@jensenpat**
(macOS `.icns` build-time generation, FlexControl wheel modes, popout
frameless lifecycle), **@chibondking** (Windows UI scaling settings
path), **@rfoust** (DAX IQ Windows/non-PipeWire-Linux fix, RX output
panel rebuild, TCI volume/drive/rx_volume dispatch), **@aethersdr-agent**
(AetherClaude — parallel implementations on `aetherclaude-eligible`
issues, including #2550 spot background_color), **@s53zo**, and
**@M7HNF-Ian** for contributions across this cycle.

### New features

**S-History v2 — voice signal detection + QRM classification (#2426)**
- New CNN classifier on the panadapter that distinguishes confirmed
  voice signals from QRM channels in the Signal History overlay.
  Voice markers age out independently of QRM markers (30 s after the
  last voice-width hit); QRM channels with voice riding on top get
  both markers simultaneously so operators can see the interference
  AND the person trying to work through it.

**Connected Stations dialog when multiFLEX disabled (#2488)**
- Operators running with multiFLEX off can now see who else is on
  the radio via Help → Connected Stations. Lists every connected
  client with handle, program, station, and ownership state.

**FPS meters + performance telemetry (#2480)**
- Footer FPS readouts for spectrum / waterfall plus a
  `PerfTelemetry::recordUiHeartbeat()` hook that captures the Qt
  event-loop cadence at 50 ms intervals. Feeds the future System Info
  diagnostics dialog (#2554).

**8-axis edge resize for frameless main window (#2522)**
- The main window's frameless mode now supports the full eight-axis
  resize grip (N/S/E/W/NE/NW/SE/SW) matching the Aetherial Audio
  Channel Strip and other frameless dialogs.

**SpotHub Display tab + tunable Signal History (#2506)**
- Consolidates the SpotHub display controls into a single tab with
  Signal History tunables (qualify duration, hide-after, suspect-QRM
  threshold). Sub-tabs replaced with grouped sections.

**Frameless chrome on Memory Channels dialog (#2509)**
- The Memory Channels dialog gets the standard 18 px gradient title
  bar, grip glyph, drag-to-move, double-click-to-maximize, 8-axis
  resize — matching NetworkDiagnosticsDialog and the Channel Strip.

**Add Memory action moved into MemoryBrowsePanel (#2533)**
- The "Add memory" button now lives in the MemoryBrowsePanel itself,
  closer to where users are looking when they want to capture the
  current slice. The slice-letter badge variant was dropped — adding
  always targets the active slice without per-letter selection.

**Float popped-out applet panel as frameless project window (#2536)**
- Popping out the applet panel via the new title-bar icon (or
  Ctrl+Shift+S) now floats it as a frameless project window with the
  full chrome treatment: gradient title bar, drag handle, 8-axis
  resize. Three new title-bar icons (dock-left / dock-right / pop-out)
  replace the legacy status-bar `☰` toggle.

**Always-on-Top pin on popped-out applets (#2430, #2479)**
- Per-container pin on the popped-out applet header keeps the float
  above the panadapter window for instrument-on-instrument workflows.

**FlexControl WheelRit / WheelXit modes (#2452, #2455)**
- Two new FlexControl USB knob assignment modes drive RIT and XIT
  offsets directly without touching the slice frequency.

**Easter egg: Ctrl+Shift+A toggles starstruck pan-drag sound (#2534)**
- Hidden audio cue tied to pan dragging — off by default, no shortcut
  reservation, harmless when not enabled.

**Status-bar +PAN icon redrawn as a jagged FFT trace (#2537)**
- Replaces the previous generic icon with a 30-point jagged FFT
  spectrum trace at 5 distinct peaks — matches the actual spectrum
  visual idiom AetherSDR is built around.

### Bug fixes

**Linux waterfall smear after TX (#2527, fixes #2527-class reports)**
- 10–18 second post-TX vertical-stripe smear on Linux only. Root
  cause: `WaterfallBlanker` retained a TX-era "last good row" across
  the TX→RX transition; subsequent impulse-detection substitutions
  painted that row as a frozen vertical stripe until the ring rolled
  past it. Fix: clear `m_wfLastGoodRow` and reset `m_wfBlankerRingCount`
  on TX-exit; gate blanker substitution on `!m_transmitting`.

**Slice reduction crash + float/dock GPU corruption + exit crash (#2495, #2512)**
- Three Multi-Flex / multi-pan crashes consolidated. Slice reduction
  on disconnect cascade tripped a use-after-free in
  `wirePanadapter()`. Float→dock transitions on QRhiWidget panes
  corrupted the spectrum framebuffer until the next full repaint.
  Exit crash on rapid quit-while-streaming traced to a connection
  teardown ordering bug. All three guarded with lifetime checks.

**Spot `background_color` honored when override is off (#2550, #2560)**
- `SpotData::backgroundColor` was parsed from the FlexLib protocol
  and stored in the model, but dropped at the model→view boundary:
  `SpotMarker` didn't carry the field, the converter silently dropped
  it, and `drawSpotMarkers()` only drew the pill from the local
  Override Background color. Third-party spot sources
  (wave-flex-integrator, SpotCollector) encoding priority /
  worked-before via `background_color` now render correctly when
  Override Background is off.

**ALC gauge rewired to SW ALC meter; mirror across Phone + CW (#2552)**
- HWALC (RCA voltage telemetry) was driving the SmartSDR-equivalent
  ALC gauge, producing meaningless readings. Split into hwAlc /
  swAlc; the gauge now consumes the SW ALC meter (post-software-ALC
  SSB peak). Mirror identical gauge across Phone and CW panels with
  the new `HGauge::setFillFromRight` mode.

**DSP curve widgets: HarfBuzz reshape on every paint (#2546, #2556)**
- The DSP curve widgets (`ClientCompCurveWidget`,
  `ClientGateCurveWidget`, `ClientDeEssCurveWidget`) were calling
  `QPainter::drawText` for axis labels on every paint, forcing a
  full HarfBuzz reshape per frame. Cache axis labels as `QStaticText`
  with `AggressiveCaching`; ~7× drop in `shapeText` cost.

**macOS app icon missing on local builds (#2558, jensenpat)**
- `docs/AetherSDR.icns` was never committed (only generated inside
  the macos-dmg CI runner), so every local macOS dev build silently
  produced a generic-icon `.app`. Fixed by moving icns generation
  into CMake via `add_custom_command` sourced from the committed
  `docs/logo-circle.png`. No new build dependencies.

**Stream Deck mute toggle TCI command (#2519)**
- The mute action on Stream Deck mappings sent the wrong TCI command.
  Corrected to the canonical mute/unmute primitive.

**DAX IQ silently broken on Windows / non-PipeWire Linux (#2524)**
- DAX IQ streams produced no output on Windows and on Linux systems
  without PipeWire (PulseAudio-only). Root cause: the IQ stream
  setup path assumed PipeWire native and silently returned without
  initialization on other platforms. Adds the proper fallback.

**Windows ClangCL build failures (#2525)**
- ClangCL toolchain failures for NR4/specbleach and other modules
  resolved with target-specific include path adjustments.

**Memory recall radio state sync (#2526)**
- Recalling a memory entry now correctly syncs all radio state (mode,
  filter, slice settings) instead of just frequency.

**RADE mode not disabled on PTT release (#2517)**
- Mic metering during RADE TX could be interrupted if RADE auto-
  disabled on key-up. Now stays in RADE mode across PTT cycles.

**RX output panel rebuild with canonical meter ballistics (#2514)**
- Aetherial Audio Channel Strip's RX output panel rebuilt to use the
  canonical `MeterSmoother` ballistics (30 ms attack, 180 ms release
  at 120 Hz) — matches every other meter in the app.

**XVTR Flex band-stack key uses status index, not order (#2342, #2511)**
- Band-stack persistence keyed off the position-in-list of XVTR
  entries; if the radio reordered them, recall pulled the wrong
  entry. Now keys on the radio-supplied status index.

**Frameless float popout follows frameless setting (#2449)**
- Popped-out applets now respect the global "use frameless windows"
  preference — previously they were always system-decorated.

**MIDI toggle params + modeUp/Down + category filter (#2446)**
- Toggle MIDI params no longer auto-revert on note release.
  Adds `modeUp` / `modeDown` actions. Category filter in MIDI Learn
  expanded to cover every action group.

**RTTY squelch auto-disable (#2504, #2510)**
- Switching to RTTY mode now auto-disables squelch (squelch on RTTY
  notches characters out and breaks decoding).

**NR4 button disabled when libspecbleach unavailable (#2484, #2508)**
- Builds without `libspecbleach` left the NR4 button live but
  no-op — confusing operators about what NR4 actually does. Button
  is now disabled with a tooltip when the dependency is missing.

**CWX release TX when queue drains (#2450, #2507)**
- CWX macros could leave the radio stuck in TX if the queue drained
  without an explicit end-of-message marker. Now releases TX when
  the queue is empty.

**Audio mute restore on reconnect (#2489)**
- Reconnecting to the radio no longer restores per-slice audio mute
  state — that's a radio-authoritative setting per the
  Radio-Authoritative Settings Policy.

**QsoRecorder QTimer playback → QAudioSink pull mode (#2295, #2487)**
- QSO recorder playback used a `QTimer` to push audio buffers,
  producing audible glitches under high system load. Rewritten to
  `QAudioSink` pull mode for glitch-free playback.

**Slice capacity clamp to model limit (#2477)**
- Some radio models report a slice count higher than they actually
  support. Client now clamps to the model-specific limit.

**DVK F1-F12 shortcut conflict with CwxPanel (#2464, #2469)**
- F-key shortcuts triggered both DVK and CWX panels when both were
  visible. Resolved via panel-scoped shortcut routing.

**ShackSwitch button stale visibility (#2456)**
- Top-right tray's ShackSwitch button stayed visible after the
  ShackSwitch feature was disabled. Now toggles in lockstep.

**RX applet radeActivated guard (#2376)**
- `RxApplet` was missing the RADE-active guard that `VfoWidget`
  uses — could fire stale mode-change events while RADE was busy.

**Avoid unchanged spot overlay repaints (#2474)**
- Spot marker list was being rebuilt and repainted on every spot
  source update even when no visual change occurred. New
  `spotMarkersVisuallyEqual()` predicate gates the repaint.

**Reassert desired panadapter and waterfall display rates (#2465)**
- Radio reconnect could silently leave the panadapter and waterfall
  at the radio's default display rate (10 Hz) instead of the
  client's configured rate. Now reasserted on every reconnect.

**Windows 48 kHz L-R audio pan (#2403, #2459)**
- L-R audio panning was incorrect on the Windows 48 kHz resampler
  path. Restored to match the macOS / native-rate paths.

**Protocol: send client program/low_bw_connect before client gui (#2466)**
- Subscription order matters on the FlexLib side; sending `client
  program` and `client low_bw_connect` after `client gui` caused
  intermittent rejection of metadata. Reordered to match what
  SmartSDR-for-Windows does.

**TCI volume/drive/rx_volume command dispatch (#1764, #2463)**
- Three TCI v2.0 commands had no dispatch wiring on AetherSDR's
  side. Added the three handlers + bidirectional state sync.

**Spectrum cursor update guards (#2461)**
- Spectrum cursor position updates fired without checking widget
  lifetime, producing rare null-deref crashes during layout changes.

**AmpApplet telemetry forwarding (#2444)**
- Amplifier telemetry from the radio (id, vac, meffa, temp) was
  parsed but not forwarded to `AmpApplet`. Wired through.

**Windows UI scaling settings path (#2443)**
- Pre-Qt settings read on Windows used the Linux path convention.
  Corrected to `%APPDATA%/AetherSDR/`.

**FreeDV Station Msg live-update without restart (#2476)**
- The Station Msg field in FreeDV settings required an app restart
  to take effect. Now live-updates the reporter.

**Container pop-out glyph + size (#2499)**
- Switches the pop-out glyph to `⧉` at a larger size for
  discoverability.

**Minimal mode hides dock-side icons (#2562)**
- The three dock-side selectors (left dock, right dock, pop-out)
  and their separator are now hidden in minimal mode — they have
  no meaning when the spectrum is hidden.

**View → Applet Panel / Pop Out menu entries removed (#2540)**
- Both menu entries are redundant with the new title-bar dock-side
  icons (#2536) and the Ctrl+Shift+S window-scoped shortcut.

**Reconnect dialog chrome polish (#2541)**
- The reconnect dialog gets the frameless gradient title bar and
  proper chrome to match the rest of the app.

### Closed without fix

**`_platform_memmove` cost in macOS backing-store flush (#2547, #2548)**
- Two related claims about Qt's widget-RHI fallback cost on macOS
  (#2547) and 30 Hz hidden-widget timer storms (#2548). Implemented
  the #2548 fix in full (~150 LOC, 10 widgets timer-gated on
  visibility) and measured before/after with `perf record -F 99 -g`
  on Linux: paint pipeline cost moved 16.8 % → 15.7 %, within noise.
  Reverted; closed both as `wontfix`. Reopen with matched windowed
  macOS profiling if the cost ever reproduces.

### Infrastructure

**Buffered async file logging (#2478)**
- AetherSDR's log file path now flushes via a buffered async writer
  to avoid blocking the GUI thread on slow disks (especially network
  shares on macOS).

**FPS meters + perf telemetry framework (#2480)**
- Foundation for the System Info diagnostics dialog (#2554) — see
  Features above.

**actions/cache bump 4 → 5 (#2493)**
- Dependabot bump for the GitHub Actions cache action.

**Qt 6.7+ GPU rendering requirement documented (#2531, #756)**
- README now documents the minimum Qt version for GPU spectrum
  rendering. Older Qt falls back to CPU rasterization.

**README supported hardware refresh (#2532)**
- Aurora 510M, RT-series, ML-series, CL-series additions to the
  Supported Hardware list. AU-520 confirmed working.

**libopengl0 build dep documented (#2523)**
- Ubuntu/Debian build instructions now list `libopengl0` explicitly.

**1.0 release prep — stale reference sweep (#2515)**
- Sweep across CLAUDE.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and
  `docs/architecture-pipelines.md` removing pre-1.0 framing and
  TODO breadcrumbs.

## [v0.9.8] — 2026-05-06

### Aetherial Audio Channel Strip RX + community-driven reliability sweep

A focused 24-hour sweep around the Aetherial Audio Channel Strip's RX
side and a long list of community-contributed fixes. The RX panel
gains DESS, full final-output / waveform stages, ADSP cluster bypass,
and parity with the TX layout. Hamlib NET-rigctl interoperability is
unblocked end-to-end — Not1MM, MacLoggerDX, fldigi, and any other
standard rigctld client can now drive AetherSDR's frequency, mode,
filter passband, RF power, PTT, and CW. The release also clears two
silent Windows footguns (UI Scale on Windows was completely broken;
spot clients crashed on disconnect cascade), and lands a CW-knob UX
upgrade plus a dialog chrome refit on the AetherDSP Settings window.

Big thanks to **@chibondking** (CJ Johnson — editable CW value fields,
cwDelay optimistic-update, UI Scale Windows + reset-to-100% fix, macOS
relaunch via `open -n`, PGXL OPERATE/STANDBY sync), **@jensenpat**
(spot client thread affinity Windows crash, hardware-PTT mic_selection
fix, filter width indicator, mode-correct widen/narrow shortcuts,
Not1MM rigctld interop), **@rfoust** (Robbie Foust — status bar
separator dot fix, audio shutdown null-guards), and **@s53zo** (MIDI
VFO jog-wheel stabilization). Also crediting **@ct1drb** for the
original orphaned rigctld pipe-separator fix that #2438 cherry-picked.

### New features

**Aetherial Audio Channel Strip — RX side (#2425)**
- The Channel Strip now has a fully-built RX path alongside the TX
  path. RX side mirrors the TX layout: AGC-G (formerly AGC-T), EQ,
  De-Esser, Compressor, Tube/Saturator, PUDU, Final Output, and
  Waveform tiles, all wired through the inline RX DSP pipeline in
  AudioEngine.
- The CHAIN status row's ADSP tile is now a Stage-style toggle that
  bypasses the entire client-side NR cluster (NR2 / NR4 / MNR / DFNR
  / RN2 / BNR) with a single click; an in-memory snapshot restores
  the prior NR state on un-bypass.
- ChannelStripPresets schema gains an optional `rx` block so saved
  profiles capture both TX and RX state. Old preset files without
  the block leave RX state untouched (forward-compatible).
- New StripRxOutputPanel with peak/RMS meter, MUTE, BOOST. Strip-side
  Waveform panel becomes side-aware so the same widget renders the
  TX or RX scope tap based on a `Side::Tx | Side::Rx` flag.

**Editable CW Delay / Speed / Sidetone / Pitch fields (#2429, chibondking)**
- The four CW value labels in the PhoneCwApplet are now `QLineEdit`
  widgets. Click any value and type a number directly — SmartSDR
  parity. `QIntValidator` clamps to the valid range, `editingFinished`
  drives the slider so the existing slider→model command path fires
  unchanged. `hasFocus()` guards on the slider valueChanged path AND
  on `syncCwFromModel` keep mid-edit input from being clobbered by
  radio echoes.

**Hamlib NET-rigctl / Not1MM interoperability (#2438, jensenpat, closes #2048 #2108)**
- Pipe separator (`|`) — rigctld's wire convention. AetherSDR only
  recognised `;`, so every pipe-prefixed command returned `RPRT -4`.
  Cherry-picks the orphaned PR #2051 fix from @ct1drb with full
  attribution.
- Multi-line bare `b` send_morse — Hamlib spec allows the morse text
  on the next line. Per-connection `m_pendingMorseLine` flag arms the
  next handleLine call to consume morse text verbatim. Required by
  Not1MM contest CW.
- RFPOWER `get_level` / `set_level` — was returning `RPRT -11` (silent
  failure). Wires through to `TransmitModel::setRfPower / rfPower()`
  with proper 0.0–1.0 ratio ↔ 0–100 percent conversion. `dump_state`
  set_level mask was hardcoded to KEYSPD only — now correctly reflects
  the full RFPOWER + KEYSPD set.
- Per-mode filter passband placement — `cmdSetMode` was applying the
  USB convention to every non-LSB mode, so `M CW 250` produced a
  155 Hz filter centered at 172 Hz instead of a 250 Hz filter centered
  on 0. Mirrors the canonical mode→filter-edge mapping from
  `VfoWidget::applyFilterPreset`.

**AetherDSP Settings dialog refit + VFO DSP launchers**
- AetherDSP Settings dialog gets the standard frameless 18 px gradient
  title bar (matching NetworkDiagnosticsDialog and AetherialAudioStrip)
  with grip glyph, min/max/close trio, drag-to-move, double-click to
  maximize, 8-axis resize.
- New `setDialogMode(true)` on AetherDspWidget bumps every inline
  font-size to 13 px to match the VFO DSP toggle row, applies a
  parallel 60×24 / 70×26 toggle-button geometry. Applet path leaves
  this off.
- Per-slice VFO DSP grid gains an `ADSP` button (opens AetherDSP
  Settings — same entry point as the Settings menu) and an
  `AetherVoice` button (toggles the Aetherial Audio Channel Strip).

### Bug fixes

**Spot client thread affinity Windows crash (#2420, jensenpat, fixes #1929 #2418)**
- `QTcpSocket` / `QUdpSocket` / `QWebSocket` create an internal
  `QSocketNotifier` whose Win32 message-loop affinity binds to the
  *construction* thread, not the QObject's current thread. Constructing
  on main-thread then `moveToThread()` to `SpotClients` left the
  notifier bound to main-thread; disconnect-cascade socket events
  tripped a cross-thread `sendEvent` assert. Each client now defers
  socket creation to an `initialize()` slot dispatched on the worker
  thread via `Qt::QueuedConnection` so internal notifiers bind there.

**Audio callbacks during shutdown (#2413, rfoust)**
- Quit-time crash on macOS where `WanConnection::~WanConnection`
  triggered a TLS disconnect cascade that emitted
  `radioTransmittingChanged(false)` after `m_audio` was already null
  but before `QObject::~QObject` had auto-disconnected the connected
  lambdas. Surgical null guards on the three TX-state callbacks
  (`moxChanged`, `txAudioGateChanged`, `radioTransmittingChanged`)
  match the existing `if (m_audio && ...)` pattern used elsewhere in
  the file.

**Hardware PTT into radio with mic_selection=PC (#2431, jensenpat, fixes #2373 #2200)**
- The interlock gate was forcing `setTransmitting(false)` whenever
  `m_txRequested` was false — even when the radio reported our handle
  as TX owner. Hardware-keyed PTT (mic-line, ACC footswitch, RCA
  TXREQ) had no bypass. PC mic audio with hardware PTT had likely
  never worked through this branch. Parses the radio's interlock
  `source=` field (SW / MIC / ACC / RCA / TUNE per FlexLib v4.2.18
  `ParsePTTSource`) and adds `MIC|ACC|RCA` to the bypass list. SW
  source still requires `m_txRequested` so SSB optimistic-off
  responsiveness is preserved.

**UI Scale not applied on Windows; reset to 100% silently ignored (#2432, chibondking)**
- Two unrelated bugs in `main.cpp`'s pre-Qt settings read. (1) The
  pre-Qt path was hardcoded to `~/.config/AetherSDR/` (Linux
  convention); on Windows AppSettings actually writes to
  `%APPDATA%/AetherSDR/`, so the file was never found and
  `QT_SCALE_FACTOR` never set. Adds a `Q_OS_WIN` branch using
  `qEnvironmentVariable("APPDATA")`. (2) The `if (pct != 100)` guard
  meant a child process inheriting `QT_SCALE_FACTOR` from a scaled
  parent kept using it after the user reset to 100%. Always-set fix
  writes `1.00` so the inherited value is overridden.

**macOS relaunch via `open -n` on UI Scale restart (#2434, chibondking)**
- `applyUiScale()` was calling `QProcess::startDetached` on
  `applicationFilePath()`, which on a `.app` bundle launches
  `Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/Foo` directly — bypassing Launch Services.
  The relaunched instance shows as a separate dock entry, loses
  proper activation policy, and on notarized/sandboxed builds can
  fail entirely. Walks up to the bundle root and launches via
  `open -n <bundle>` with `--args` pass-through.

**MIDI jog-wheel VFO tuning stabilization (#2422, s53zo, fixes #2421)**
- Three independent failure modes on touch-sensitive jog wheels (e.g.
  Hercules DJControl Starlight). MIDI Learn could bind the touch
  sensor instead of the movement CC. Saved bindings without the
  relative flag interpreted unit-pulse 1/127 as absolute endpoints,
  turning each detent into ~±63 steps. Tuning targets read
  `SliceModel::frequency()` which lags behind in-flight tune commands,
  making rapid spins jump backward. Fixed in three layered passes
  with a 250 ms idle-timer-cleared in-flight tune target.

**VFO filter width indicator showing 0.1 kHz too low (#2435, jensenpat, fixes #2197)**
- `updateFilterLabel()` computed raw `filterHigh - filterLow`, which
  for SSB/digital modes is ~100 Hz less than the named preset width
  due to the intentional low-cut. Bug had been reported three times
  (#794, #1225, this issue) — the structural fix promotes
  `RxApplet::formatFilterWidth` to public static and has VfoWidget
  call it directly. Single source of truth prevents the next swap.

**Mode-correct filter widen/narrow shortcuts (#2436, jensenpat, fixes #2208)**
- The `filter_widen` / `filter_narrow` shortcuts (also bound to MIDI
  `global.filterWiden` / `global.filterNarrow`) only adjusted the
  upper edge by ±100 Hz. On LSB / CWL / DIGL / RTTY the upper edge is
  fixed near 0, so "widen" actually collapsed the passband. New
  `RxApplet::stepFilterWidth(direction)` walks the active mode's
  preset list and routes through `applyFilterPreset` so all modes get
  mode-correct edge geometry.

**PGXL OPERATE/STANDBY button stuck on OPERATE (#2437, chibondking)**
- AmpApplet button was only updated via the direct PGXL TCP path; if
  that lagged, the button stayed on the old label. The click handler
  reads `m_operateBtn->text()` to decide toggle direction, so a
  stuck OPERATE button emitted `operate=0` on click — sending another
  standby command instead of returning to OPERATE. Wires
  `RadioModel::ampStateChanged` (authoritative) to also call
  `AmpApplet::setState`.

**Status bar separator dots for unsupported optional sections (#2412, rfoust)**
- TGXL and PGXL separator dots stayed visible even when the indicators
  were hidden, leaving stray `· ·` clusters in the bottom status bar
  on radios without those accessories. Optional separators now toggle
  in lockstep with their matching indicators.

**cwDelay optimistic-update prevents Delay slider reset (#2428, chibondking)**
- `setCwDelay()` was the lone outlier in the CW setter family —
  didn't cache `ms` into `m_cwDelay` before emitting the command.
  Subsequent `phoneStateChanged` emissions read stale `m_cwDelay`
  and snapped the Delay slider back, silently re-enabling QSK on
  amplifiers that can't tolerate it. Now matches the
  `setCwBreakIn` / `setCwIambicMode` optimistic-update pattern.

**DSP-level slider missing on launch**
- The leveled DSP toggles (NR / NB / ANF / NRL / NRS / NRF / ANFL)
  push onto a target stack so the shared 4th-row slider re-targets
  the most recently activated DSP. State changes arriving from radio
  status (profile load, reconnect) went through a `QSignalBlocker`'d
  path that suppressed the `toggled()` signal — so on launch the
  slider was hidden until the user manually toggled the DSP off and
  back on. New `connectLeveledDsp` helper mirrors the user-click
  stack push/pop on every state change.

**Channel Strip initial height on sub-4K displays (#2440)**
- The Aetherial Audio Channel Strip opened at its natural 1620 px
  height on every display. On 1080p the bottom edge landed offscreen
  with the resize grip unreachable. Queries
  `QGuiApplication::primaryScreen()->availableGeometry().height()`
  at construction; caps initial height to 960 px on anything below
  ~4K (2000 px threshold catches 1080p / 1440p / 1600p). 4K and 5K
  still get the natural 1620.

### Infrastructure

**CI runtime + reliability sweep**
- Skip CodeQL on doc-only PRs (#2397).
- Cache Windows third-party deps — Opus, FFTW, hidapi, DeepFilterNet
  (#2398) — drops cold Windows builds by ~3 min.
- Mirror Opus download to GitHub Releases with retry/fallback (#2399)
  — replaces the unreliable Xiph mirror that occasionally 503s.
- Scope CodeQL to first-party sources (#2400) — drops third_party/
  noise from the analysis.
- Speed up macOS Intel build with pinned Qt + ccache (#2402).
- Bump Qt to 6.8.3 LTS across all release workflows (#2404).

## [v0.9.7] — 2026-05-05

### CW keying overhaul + reliability sweep

A focused follow-up to v0.9.6 with two themes: a substantial CW operator
upgrade — keyboard and MIDI-mapped straight key + iambic paddles, full
break-in / QSK respect on both paths, netCW timing fixes, and Apollo-era
Quindar tones on PTT engage/disengage — and a reliability sweep covering
SpotHub auto-reconnect, a TCI crash on quit, the long-standing waterfall
TX trail, hardware PTT regressions, and DAX RX latency.

Big thanks to **@jensenpat** (CW keyboard / MIDI controls, compression
meter gating, Windows MSVC runtime), **@M7HNF-Ian** (Spot Lines,
HiDPI gauge clipping, TCI crash on quit, SpotHub auto-reconnect),
**@filemakers** (connect-to-last-radio opt-out checkbox), **@NF0T**
(RADE TX policy naming + tests), **@chibondking** (live voltage gauge),
plus issue reporters **@VU2CPL** (TCI crash with full call stack),
**@luigiverdicchio1-prog** (SpotHub failed-reconnect repro), **@LU5DX**
and **@rnash2** (spectrum amplitude scale issue — under investigation).

### New features

**CW keyboard + MIDI controls (#2361, #2391, jensenpat)**
- Three new shared shortcut + MIDI actions: `Trigger straight key`,
  `Trigger CW Left Paddle`, `Trigger CW Right Paddle`. Same action IDs
  and display names for keyboard shortcuts and MIDI mappings (`cwkey` /
  `cwdit` / `cwdah`); `MidiSettings` migrates legacy dotted IDs
  (`cw.key` / `cw.dit` / `cw.dah`) on read.
- Straight key is a true momentary control: keyboard press + MIDI gate-on
  assert the netCW key path, release + gate-off release it. Paddles feed
  the local iambic keyer when running so sidetone and on-air timing stay
  aligned with WPM; falls back to a held-key path otherwise.
- Both paths now honor the radio's `break_in` setting fully — with
  `break_in=1` (QSK), key edges trigger TX and `break_in_delay` holds
  the relay between elements; with `break_in=0`, keys are queued and the
  operator engages PTT manually (Space PTT, MOX, hardware PTT). The
  previous auto-PTT envelope masked break-in OFF and killed QSK hang
  time on release.
- New clickable red TX status badge in the status bar acts as an
  emergency transmit cancel — checks Multi-Flex ownership, clears all
  local CW state, forces sidetone key-up, and sends `cw key 0` /
  `cw ptt 0` / `transmit tune 0` / `xmit 0`.
- Slider focus lease no longer blocks momentary CW shortcuts or Space
  PTT — clicking the CW delay slider previously froze J/K/L paddle
  keying and Space PTT for 2+ seconds while the lease's arrow-key
  capture timer expired.
- Pre-existing typo fix: J tile in the on-screen keyboard widget was
  bound to `Qt::Key_I`, so binding a shortcut to J in the editor
  selected I.

**Quindar tones — Apollo-era K/BK on PTT (#2334, fixes #2262)**
- Optional 2525 Hz "K" / 2475 Hz "BK" tones on PTT engage / disengage,
  modeled after Apollo CapCom audio. Lock-free DSP module wired between
  PC mic gain and the final TX limiter so tones are mixed into the
  outgoing audio. Local sidetone via a dedicated 48 kHz `QAudioSink`
  (mutually exclusive with CW mode at the mode level — Quindar and CW
  share the same sidetone bus).
- Added as the QUIN chip in the Final Output Stage panel of the
  Aetherial Audio Channel Strip with a frameless editor dialog
  (test-tone buttons + Done in the same row as the title bar).
- Disabled by default; opt-in via the chip toggle.

**netCW keying fix + trace logging (#2336, fixes a long-tail of issues)**
- Fixes netCW timing for both straight-key and iambic CW. Adds detailed
  `aether.cw` trace category logging across MIDI / keyboard input,
  netCW UDP scheduling, VITA stream/index details, and TCP fallback /
  backstop paths so future timing regressions are diagnosable from logs.

**Spot Lines toggle in SpotHub (#2349, M7HNF-Ian)**
- New "Spot Lines" toggle in the SpotHub Display settings draws vertical
  lines from the spectrum up to each spot label. Off during contests to
  reduce visual clutter; on for casual ops to keep label-to-frequency
  mapping legible at a glance.

**Network Diagnostics live logs tab (#2333)**
- New tab in the Network Diagnostics dialog with live tail of the same
  logs the diagnostics report references, scoped to the diagnostic
  categories (`aether.connection`, `aether.dxcluster`, `aether.cw`,
  etc.). Lets users diff what they're seeing against what was logged
  without leaving the dialog.

**Connect-to-last-radio opt-out checkbox (#2390, filemakers)**
- New "Connect to last radio on start up" checkbox on the connection
  dialog; defaults to ON so existing users keep current behavior. When
  unchecked, AetherSDR no longer auto-connects on startup, on
  broadcast-discovery, or on routed-radio probe — useful for operators
  who want to pick a radio manually each session. The dialog
  auto-launches at startup when opt-out is enabled so the user has a
  clear path to pick a radio.

### Bug fixes

**SpotHub auto-reconnect after failed connection attempt (#2394, M7HNF-Ian, fixes #2380)**
- SpotHub (DX cluster / RBN) didn't automatically reconnect after a
  Wi-Fi drop or any failed connection attempt — Qt's `QAbstractSocket`
  only emits `disconnected()` on Connected → Unconnected transitions,
  so when the socket failed during `ConnectingState` (host blocked,
  refused, or timed out), the reconnect timer was never armed. Extracts
  a `scheduleReconnect()` helper called from all three failure paths
  (live drop, socket error, connect timeout) with guards against
  double-scheduling. A per-call epoch counter prevents stale timeouts
  from a previous attempt aborting a later successful one. Backoff
  sequence unchanged: 5 s → 10 s → 20 s → 40 s → 60 s.

**TCI crash on quit when TciServer outlives RadioModel (#2386, M7HNF-Ian, fixes #2385)**
- `TciServer` was constructed as a `QObject` child of `MainWindow`, so
  Qt deleted it during `~QWidget::deleteChildren()` — which runs *after*
  `MainWindow`'s value members (including `m_radioModel`) have already
  destructed. `~TciServer()` → `stop()` → `releaseDaxForTci()` then
  dereferenced freed memory. EXC_BAD_ACCESS @ `0x38`, 100% reproducible
  on quit when a radio was connected. Reported by VU2CPL with full call
  stack. Fixed by explicitly tearing down `m_tciServer` in
  `~MainWindow()` after the audio thread is stopped but while
  `m_radioModel` is still alive, plus a belt-and-braces
  `QPointer<RadioModel>` so the existing null guards in
  `releaseDaxForTci()` catch any future regression automatically.

**Waterfall unfreezes on radio interlock state, not MOX edge (#2368, fixes #1927)**
- Waterfall freeze/unfreeze previously gated on the local MOX edge,
  which fired the instant the user released PTT — the radio kept
  streaming TX-contaminated tiles for the `UNKEY_REQUESTED` window, and
  those rows then took 10–23 s to scroll off the visible waterfall.
  Now driven by `RadioModel::radioTransmittingChanged` (interlock
  `state=TRANSMITTING`), so the freeze is held until the radio
  actually leaves TX. Multi-Flex bonus: any client TXing now triggers
  the freeze, not just our client.

**Honor cw break_in for keyboard CW keying (#2391)**
- `RadioModel::sendCwKey` and the iambic keyer's `onPaddleEvent` both
  unconditionally wrapped each key/squeeze in a `cw ptt 1`...`cw ptt 0`
  envelope. Made break-in OFF a no-op (auto-PTT forced TX anyway) and
  killed the radio's break_in_delay hang time with break-in ON
  (force-dropped PTT after every element). Stripped the auto-PTT in
  both paths so the radio's break-in setting decides TX behavior,
  matching SmartSDR semantics.

**Spot list double-click switches mode (#2372, fixes #2298)**
- Double-clicking a spot in the Spot List now switches the radio's
  mode along with the frequency. Previously only the frequency moved,
  leaving the user in the wrong mode for the spotted signal.

**Spot trigger includes pan= for external CAT clients (#2369, fixes #2366)**
- The spot click protocol now includes `pan=<panId>` so external CAT
  clients (N1MM Logger, etc.) consuming AetherSDR's spot triggers can
  route the click to the correct panadapter in multi-pan setups.

**Compression meter gates on radio TX state (#2363, jensenpat)**
- The TX compression meter now displays only while the radio reports
  `state=TRANSMITTING`. Previously it could read live during RX from
  stale interlock state, confusing operators about what compression
  was actually applied to their signal.

**Voltage gauge label shows live radio voltage (#2362, chibondking)**
- The voltage gauge label now reflects the live voltage value reported
  by the radio instead of the static "VOLTS" placeholder.

**Minimal mode revert on macOS when entered while maximized (#2367, fixes #2365)**
- Entering minimal mode while the window was already maximized on
  macOS would revert to a non-minimal layout immediately on toggle.
  Layout / state ordering corrected so the entry sticks regardless of
  the prior maximized state.

**MidiControlManager: drop dead paramAction signal (#2370)**
- Cleanup follow-up after #2336 introduced `paramActionTrace` —
  `paramAction` was still emitted but had zero connectors. Removed
  the orphan signal + matching declaration.

### Infrastructure

**DAX RX native pw_stream source on Linux (#2312, fixes #1008)**
- DAX RX latency on Linux drops from ~400 ms → ~200 ms via a native
  PipeWire `pw_stream` source path, replacing the previous PulseAudio
  client. Brings DAX RX latency in line with macOS / Windows.

**RADE TX policy naming + tests (#2353, NF0T, fixes #2343)**
- Renames the RADE TX policy enum to align with the issue tracking
  language (`HostedDaxBridge` etc.) and adds unit tests covering each
  `(reason, platform, mode) → (allowed, note)` decision row.

**HiDPI gauge clipping (#2346, M7HNF-Ian)**
- HGauge tick labels and TxApplet value labels were clipping on HiDPI
  displays. Layout / paint regions updated to honor device-pixel ratio.

**Windows portable ZIP includes MSVC runtime (#2364, jensenpat)**
- Windows portable ZIP now bundles the MSVC runtime DLLs so the
  portable build runs on systems without Visual C++ Redistributable
  installed — matches the experience of the installer build.

**Connection-panel slider focus lease split**
- `shortcutInputCaptured()` was conflating "slider has focus and
  arrow-key lease is active" with "user is typing in a text field",
  blocking momentary CW shortcuts and Space PTT during slider drags.
  Now split into `textInputCaptured()` (text widgets only) and
  `shortcutInputCaptured()` (text + slider lease) so QShortcut
  dispatch keeps the arrow-key behaviour while momentary actions
  bypass the lease. Bundled with #2391.

## [v0.9.6] — 2026-05-04

### Aetherial Audio Channel Strip + AetherSweep Phase 2

Headline additions: a unified **Aetherial Audio Channel Strip** that brings
every TX DSP stage (gate, EQ, compressor, de-esser, tube, AetherVoice,
reverb, and a brand-new Final Output Stage with brickwall limiter) into a
single editable window with a savable preset library — and **AetherSweep
Phase 2**, a polish pass on the in-panadapter SWR analyzer with log scale,
threshold-band shading, interpolated bandwidth at SWR ≤ 1.5 / 2.0, a
resonance caret, and band-change-aware auto-stop.  Network Diagnostics
gained trend graphs and per-series gutter hints.  RADE finally ships in
the official Windows installer.

Big thanks to **@jensenpat** (oscillator reference fix, AetherSweep
Phase 2, Connect-by-IP recents, minimal mode polish, Windows installer
packaging), **@NF0T** (RADE on Windows CI/installer, RADE mic meter
fix), **@rfoust** (Network Diagnostics trend graphs), and
**@AetherClaude** (stderr non-draining-pipe deadlock) for landing the
bulk of this release.

### New features

**Aetherial Audio Channel Strip (#2307, #2326)**
- New unified TX DSP window covering every stage in the chain: gate, EQ,
  compressor, de-esser, tube, AetherVoice (the exciter formerly known as
  PooDoo), Freeverb, plus a brand-new Final Output Stage with brickwall
  limiter, output trim, DC block, and a 1 kHz test tone.
- Savable preset library at `~/.config/AetherSDR/ChannelStrip.settings`
  (separate from `AetherSDR.settings`).  Captures every TX DSP knob, the
  user's chain order, and final-limiter parameters.  Save / Delete /
  Export Preset / Export Library buttons in the strip's preset row.
- Master/Aux BYPASS button stays in lock-step between the docked Chain
  applet and the strip via a shared engine-level snapshot — flipping it
  in either place updates both.
- Two new 4th-row panels: **Aetherial Waveform — TX** (1–20 s scope window
  with SCOPE/ENVELOPE/HISTORY modes) and **Final Output Stage** (peak-hold
  meter with GR overlay + draggable amber ceiling triangle, mouse-wheel
  ±0.1 dB).
- Logo / title rebrand: PooDoo™ exciter → **AetherVoice™** "Aetherial
  Voice Processor" with Body / Clarity emphasis controls.  Docked tile
  (`PUDU`) renamed to `EVO` on the chain widget; container button
  renamed `VUDU`.
- Double-click any TX chain tile launches the Channel Strip — replaces
  the legacy easter-egg launch nub on the Chain applet and the
  per-stage TX floating editors (`ClientDeEssEditor`,
  `ClientReverbEditor`, etc.).
- FreeVerb tile in the docked applet panel now shows the same
  decay-tail viz as the Channel Strip's reverb panel, signal-driven by
  a new `AudioEngine::clientReverbStateChanged` signal (no polling).

**AetherSweep Phase 2 (#2320, jensenpat)**
- Logarithmic SWR scale for cleaner low-ratio detail; threshold-band
  shading for SWR 1.0–1.5 (green), 1.5–2.0 (amber), and >2.0 (red).
- Resonance caret + dot at the best measured SWR point; visual
  start/end notches mark sweep endpoints.
- Interpolated bandwidth brackets at SWR ≤ 1.5 and ≤ 2.0, with a
  concise BW readout in the corner label.
- Resonant frequency display trimmed to kHz precision; corner readout
  switched from "latest sample" to best SWR + resonance frequency.
- Cleared sweep plots when the swept TX slice changes bands; if a band
  change happens while a sweep is running, the sweep stops and clears
  without restoring the old freq/pan range so cleanup doesn't fight
  the user's new band.

**Network Diagnostics trend graphs (#2309, rfoust; #2316)**
- Per-metric trend plots with Timeframe selector (1 min / 5 min /
  15 min / 1 h / 1 d / 1 w).
- Logarithmic Y-axis on the Rates tab — 0 / 1 / 10 / 100 / 1k kbps
  decades all visible at once instead of being squashed at the
  baseline.
- Per-series last-sample hints in the left gutter — small
  color-coded values that always show the latest reading for each
  visible stream, with a 6 px-tall solid centerline alpha gradient
  to keep the labels legible against the trace.
- Frameless chrome with draggable title bar + 8-axis resize matching
  the rest of AetherSDR's floating windows.

**RADE in the official Windows installer (#2324, NF0T)**
- `ENABLE_RADE=ON` for both the Windows CI job and the official
  installer workflow.  Vendored RADE-prepared Opus + neural-net
  weights are statically linked, so no new DLLs ship — `AetherSDR.exe`
  grows ~8–12 MB to match the AppImage.
- New `Build Opus (RADE dependency)` CI step provides clean failure
  attribution and matches the AppImage workflow's pattern.  Closes
  reports of "RADE absent from Windows installer".

**Connect by IP recents dropdown (#2296, jensenpat)**
- Connect-by-IP field is now a combo box pre-populated with the last
  five addresses (stored as `RecentDirectIpAddresses`).  Successful
  connect promotes the address to the top of the list.

**Black slider auto-offset (#2328)**
- Spectrum Overlay menu's Black slider now drives a noise-floor target
  offset while AUTO is engaged: 50 = at the noise floor (today's
  behaviour); lower = darker (push threshold above the floor); higher
  = lighter.  Manual mode keeps existing semantics.  Both stored
  values persist independently so toggling AUTO swaps the slider
  position without losing either preference.

**Minimal mode polish (#2290, jensenpat; #2299)**
- Title bar drag now reaches the gutter and other previously-dead
  zones via sub-pixel hit testing.  Exit paths from minimal mode
  consolidated; layout stops fighting on toggle.

**Aetherial Noise Reduction docked applet (#2297)**
- Client-side NR controls live in their own docked applet under
  PooDoo Audio (RX); the redundant DSP sub-panel was removed from
  the Spectrum Overlay menu for a cleaner DSP surface.

### Bug fixes

**Oscillator reference status no longer goes stale (#2329, jensenpat)**
- New `RadioModel::oscillatorChanged()` signal drives the status-bar
  reference label and Radio Setup combo immediately from oscillator
  state, instead of relying on event ordering with GPS status.
  Eliminates the case where the status bar got stuck on the previous
  reference if a GPS update never arrived after the oscillator
  transition.
- Radio Setup dropdown preserves currently-selected/actual options
  during presence transitions, so transient flag blips no longer
  drop the active option from the combo.  Renamed `External` →
  `External 10 MHz` to match the FlexLib API description.
- Status-bar tooltips now show desired setting, actual source, lock
  state, and GPS/external details.

**RADE mic level meter + gain slider (#2292, NF0T)**
- The RADE TX mic level meter now updates while the modem is active,
  and the gain slider is enabled instead of stuck at zero.  Fixes
  "no apparent way to set RADE mic level" reports.

**Stderr non-draining pipe deadlock (#2300, AetherClaude)**
- When stdout/stderr was redirected to a pipe with no reader, the
  audio worker thread could deadlock writing log lines.  Replaced
  blocking writes with a non-blocking path that drops on the floor
  rather than stalling the thread.

**Windows installer runtime packaging (#2303, jensenpat)**
- Tightened Windows runtime-DLL bundling for a smaller installer and
  fewer "missing DLL" reports on first launch.

### Infrastructure

**v0.9.5.1 release-notes expansion (#2288, #2289)**
- The CHANGELOG entry for v0.9.5.1 was expanded post-release to
  cover all post-v0.9.5 fixes (#2113 reachability sweep, the four
  rfoust polish PRs, NR2 audio-thread + Qt-log hotfixes) with full
  contributor shoutouts.

## [v0.9.5.1] — 2026-05-02

### Stability & polish hotfix sweep

A focused follow-up release that lands the TCI TX policy hotfix plus six
post-v0.9.5 fixes already in main: SmartLink WAN reconnect after radio
drops, sequenced WAN disconnect teardown, RX slice-tab reset between
radios with different slice counts, macOS panadapter pop-out live
updates and dock-splitter layout, NR2 wisdom-generation safety on the
audio thread, and a Qt log-handler serialization fix that resolves a
macOS tune-time crash.

Big thanks to **@rfoust** (four SmartLink / disconnect / macOS polish
fixes) and **@jensenpat** (NR2 audio-thread safety + Qt log
serialization) for landing the bulk of this release.

### Bug fixes

**TCI TX silent on Windows / Linux non-PipeWire (#2276)**
- `evaluateDaxTxPolicy()` now always allows `DaxTxRequestReason::TciTxAudio`
  regardless of platform / hosted-DAX availability.  TCI receives audio
  over WebSocket and feeds it into a dedicated `dax_tx` stream that's
  independent of SmartSDR DAX2 (which owns the Windows DAX *audio
  devices*, not the radio's `dax_tx` stream slot — multiple GUI clients
  can each register their own).
- Test assertions in `tests/radio_status_ownership_test.cpp` flipped to
  match the corrected policy and a new Linux-non-PipeWire test case
  added.

**SmartLink reconnect after WAN drop (#2282, rfoust)**
- `MainWindow` now owns a WAN reconnect timer that re-requests a
  SmartLink radio connection using the last selected WAN radio when
  `RadioModel` reports an unexpected WAN disconnect, instead of
  leaving the app stuck on the "Radio disconnected — waiting for
  reconnect" popup.
- `SmartLinkClient::reconnect()` refreshes Auth0 credentials via the
  saved refresh token before reconnecting, avoiding reuse of an
  expired `id_token`.  Auth-refresh failure stops the retry loop and
  shows a sign-in-required status instead of retrying forever.
- `RadioModel::forceDisconnect()` now handles WAN connections so
  missed pings transition the app to disconnected/reconnecting
  promptly.  Ping watchdog logs and forces disconnect once per outage
  rather than every second.
- `PanadapterStack::prepareShutdown()` releases QRhi GPU resources
  before main-window teardown to avoid the macOS Metal teardown crash
  that could fire after a stale-state Disconnect.

**SmartLink disconnect teardown (#2278, rfoust)**
- WAN disconnect previously closed the WAN socket *after* disconnecting
  RadioModel's signals and nulled `m_wanConn` directly, skipping
  `RadioModel::onDisconnected()` cleanup entirely.  Panadapters,
  slices, meters, and streams stayed alive in the model after the user
  clicked Disconnect.
- Now runs the normal model teardown path on intentional WAN
  disconnect, so WAN sessions emit `connectionStateChanged(false)` and
  clear model state the same way LAN disconnects do.

**Reset RX slice tabs on disconnect between radios with different slice counts (#2254, rfoust)**
- `RxApplet::clearSliceButtons()` tears down generated slice tab buttons
  and restores the static slice badge on disconnect.  Stale A–H buttons
  no longer linger after switching from a high-slice radio to a
  smaller one.
- `MainWindow`'s `infoChanged` initializer is now per-connection rather
  than one-shot, so each radio rebuilds its slice row from its own
  `maxSlices`.  Slice button click connections are guarded against
  duplicate signal handlers across reconnects.

**Qt log handler serialization fixes macOS tune-time crash (#2284, jensenpat)**
- The global `qInstallMessageHandler` callback wrote through a single
  `QFile*` without synchronization, and concurrent `qCInfo`/`qDebug`
  output from main + worker threads corrupted Qt's internal file
  write-buffer state.  The tune-policy diagnostic line happened to be
  the log call that exposed the corruption — the failing object was
  the logging sink, not the Flex tune command path.
- Now serializes the handler with an intentionally leaked mutex
  (mirroring the existing shutdown-safe treatment of the redaction
  regexes) and replaces per-message `QTextStream` wrapping with a
  direct UTF-8 `QFile::write()`/`flush()` path.  No change to radio
  command ordering or panadapter policy.

**macOS panadapter pop-out refresh + multi-pan dock layout (#2280, rfoust)**
- Detached panadapter windows on macOS no longer show a static/stale
  spectrum image.  Cross-window reparenting now resets the native
  QRhi/Metal surface and re-requests pan dimensions from the radio
  after every float/dock cycle.
- Saved floating-window state is no longer restored after later
  user-added pans, so adding a second panadapter does not spawn an
  unwanted blank floating window.
- `rebuildDockedSplitter()` keeps the main-window splitter compact
  when multiple pans float/dock — no more empty placeholder slots.

**NR2 wisdom generation no longer freezes the audio thread (#2275, jensenpat)**
- `AudioEngine::needsWisdomGeneration()` previously only checked
  whether `aethersdr_fftw_wisdom` existed.  If the file was stale or
  incompatible (e.g. `fftw-3.3.10` header on a build that uses FFTW
  3.3.11), `setNr2Enabled()` ran full FFTW wisdom generation on the
  audio worker thread, blocking RX audio and the WAVE scope for
  several minutes.
- Adds `SpectralNR::loadWisdom()` for import-only validation, makes
  `needsWisdomGeneration()` return true when the file exists but
  cannot be imported, and routes generation through the existing
  background progress dialog instead of the audio thread.  If wisdom
  import fails at enable time, NR2 falls back to runtime
  `FFTW_MEASURE` plans rather than hanging audio.

## [v0.9.5] — 2026-05-02

### Reliability sweep + DAX2 coexistence overhaul

A focused stability release.  Headline is **DAX2 coexistence policy
(jensenpat)** — a centralized decision table that makes AetherSDR's
behaviour next to SmartSDR DAX, hosted DAX (macOS / PipeWire), and
external Flex tooling explicit, testable, and consistently logged.
Plus substantial improvements to **disconnect teardown** (sequenced
`stream remove` with response wait — fixes the Flex-6300 unreachable-
after-reconnect bug), **worker-thread shutdown** (no more `killTimer`
warnings on app exit), **panadapter zoom** (no spectrum flash), and
**multi-flex spot/ATU handling** (DXCluster spot trigger_action removal,
ATU per-frequency toggle).

A two-PR **issue triage cleanup** closed 12 long-standing issues across
small UI bugs, contrast, indicator routing, click-to-tune behaviour,
and visible regressions from recent feature work.

### Features

**Aetherial Parametric EQ Smoothing combo (#2236)**
- New Smoothing combo on the EQ analyzer with 1/24, 1/12, 1/6, 1/3,
  1/1 octave fractional smoothing options (linear-power averaging).
  Persists via `EqAnalyzerSmoothing`; defaults to 1/12 octave.
- Audio-domain band-plan strip on the EQ canvas + dashed yellow filter
  cutoff guides for both TX and RX.  Cutoff guides are draggable to
  retune filter edges with mode-aware USB/LSB/AM/FM offset conversion.
- Phone applet Low/High Cut buttons snap to nearest 50 Hz.
- ~30 % faster smoothing inner loop after replacing
  `std::pow(10, x/10)` with `std::exp(x * ln(10)/10)` (#2239).

**Custom filter edges with persistence (#2272)**
- Right-click a filter button → **Set Custom Edges...** opens a
  2-spinbox dialog.  Asymmetric `lo:hi` pairs persist in
  `FilterPresets_<mode>` via a new mixed `width` / `lo:hi` storage
  format (backward compat preserved for existing width-only entries).
- **Reset to Default** is now per-slot.
- FilterPassbandWidget shows signed lo/hi/center values so LSB/CW
  filters reveal sideband.
- Filter-edge grab zone in the spectrum bumped from 5px to 8px so
  edges sitting near the VFO line are easier to grab.

**Spot click client-side mode mapping (#2272)**
- All client-ingested spots (DXCluster, RBN, POTA, SpotCollector,
  FreeDV, WSJT-X, manual) now ship with `trigger_action=none`.  The
  radio no longer auto-acts on stored mode strings (which mishandled
  "SSB" and similar non-Flex tokens, falling back to CW).
- AetherSDR's auto-mode mapping handles tune+mode client-side.
  Default flipped to enabled.
- FreeDV-source spots activate the RADE engine via `activateRADE()`
  (sets DIGU/DIGL plus the OFDM modem) instead of just landing on a
  plain digital mode.

**ATU per-frequency toggle (#2272)**
- ATU button now mirrors SmartSDR's behaviour: first click on a
  frequency tunes; second click at the same frequency bypasses; freq
  change resets the toggle so the next click tunes again.

### Bug fixes

**DAX2 coexistence policy (#2271, jensenpat)**
- New `DaxTxPolicy.h` decision table: `(reason, platform, mode) →
  (allowed, note)`.  Centralizes platform-aware DAX TX decisions with
  explicit reasons (HostedDaxBridge, TciTxAudio, ExternalDaxRouteOnly,
  GenericAudioRecreate) and consistent log notes at every branch.
- Lazy `dax_tx` stream creation via `RadioModel::ensureDaxTxStream()`
  — eager creation at GUI attach is removed so SmartSDR DAX can own
  the Windows route.
- `daxTxStatusCanUpdateLocalState()` anti-stomp: foreign DAX TX
  status can no longer accidentally adopt our tracked stream slot.
- LAN VITA UDP rebind path: on Flex's `0x500000A9` "Port/IP pair
  already in use" error, AetherSDR rebinds to an OS-assigned ephemeral
  port and retries `client udpport`.  WAN/SmartLink already used
  ephemeral ports and is correctly excluded from the rebind path.
- Dead-orphan DAX RX detection: `client_handle=0 ip=0.0.0.0` entries
  are ignored as not-our-stream rather than treated as legacy-compat.
- External DAX TX/RX visibility: separate seen-once log lines so the
  radio's external streams are visible in diagnostic logs without
  polluting our local state.
- 24 + test assertions across `testStreamStatusOwnershipCompatibility`,
  `testDaxTxStatusOwnership`, `testDaxTxPolicy`, and
  `testUdpRegistrationPolicy`.
- Linux non-PipeWire builds correctly skip both `setDax(1)` and DAX
  stream creation, so digital TX falls back to the physical mic input
  rather than going silent (#2273).

**Sequenced radio disconnect teardown (#2247, jensenpat)**
- Fixes Flex-6300 / 6400 unreachability after reconnect (#2113, #2218).
- Disconnect now sends `stream remove 0x<id>` and waits up to 2 s for
  the radio's response before closing TCP.  Without this, fire-and-
  forget teardown left stale Flex sessions that refused subsequent
  connects until reboot.
- Drops the rejected `client disconnect <self_handle>` send — verified
  against FlexLib's own self-disconnect path, which uses the `0x04`
  "dying gasp" byte before TCP close.  AetherSDR now does the same.
- Defensive auto-reconnect arms on refused-connect paths that don't
  emit a `disconnected` signal.

**Worker object shutdown thread affinity (#2248, rfoust)**
- Eliminates `QObject::killTimer: Timers cannot be stopped from
  another thread`, `QObject::moveToThread: Current thread is not the
  object thread`, and `~QObject` warnings on app exit.
- Worker-thread QObjects (audio engine, spot clients, ext controllers,
  radio connection, panadapter stream) are now destroyed via
  `deleteLater()` on their owning threads before each thread quits.

**Panadapter zoom keeps spectrum visible (#2246, rfoust)**
- New `reprojectSpectrum()` mirrors the existing waterfall reprojection.
  Zoom changes that overlap with the previous range now interpolate
  existing FFT bins forward instead of clearing them, eliminating the
  spectrum flash/blank during pinch / wheel / drag zoom.

**TGXL detected via direct TCP only (#2250, chrisb1964)**
- TUN applet now appears for TGXLs that don't report through the
  amplifier API (Flex-8600 fw 4.2.18).  New `m_directPresence` fallback
  in `TunerModel`; `isPresent()` returns true via either path.
- Handles bare `amplifier <handle> removed` form correctly via a new
  `ampRemovedRe` regex (matches FlexLib's `s.Contains("removed")`
  semantics for both bare-flag and kvs-form removals).

**RX slice tab capacity initialization (#2243, chibondking)**
- RX slice tab capacity is now seeded from the radio model on connect
  rather than left at the default — fixes empty tabs when reconnecting
  to a different radio model.

**Radio model label refresh (#2244, jensenpat)**
- Radio model label refreshes on `info` command response, so
  reconnecting to a different model immediately reflects the new
  identity in the UI.

**FreeDV Reporter OS string (#2269, tmiw)**
- OS field lowercased to match the official FreeDV client convention.
  Previously AetherSDR users showed as "other" in monthly platform
  reports.  Thanks Mooneer.

**FreeDV Reporter checkbox visibility (#2268, NF0T)**
- Three checkboxes in the FreeDV Reporter tab were rendering with no
  visible borders against the dark background.  Applied the standard
  `ConnectionPanel` checkbox style.

**AppletPanel scrollbar (#2257, Chaosuk97)**
- AppletPanel scrollbar widened from 6 px to 12 px with a dim handle
  at rest that brightens to `#4a6880` on hover or drag.  500 ms
  delay before dimming back so quick scroll gestures don't flicker.
  Always-visible track to match the rest of the app.

**Sweep 1 — 7 small UI / contrast fixes (#2270)**
- `AetherSDR vX.Y.Z` shown again in the in-app title bar — restored
  after the frameless-window mode regression (#2027).
- FlexControl knob press tokens are bare `S` / `C` / `L`, not
  `X4S` / `X4C` / `X4L`.  Captured against LB2EG's hardware (#2263).
- Å Morse sequence corrected to `01101` (`·−−·−`) per ITU-R M.1677-1
  (#2264, LB2EG).
- Single-click-to-tune suppressed across the entire K / SFI / WNB /
  RF Gain / WIDE indicator strip in the top-right of the spectrum,
  not just the propagation text (#1564).
- Slice record (⏺) and play (▶) indicator alpha values doubled for
  legibility against the dark spectrum background (#1576).
- Status indicators (TNF / CWX / DVK / FDX) unified to cyan
  (`#00b4d8`) for active and dark grey (`#404858`) for off; TNF init
  colour bug fixed (was semi-transparent white) (#1581).
- Status bar time stack: removed grid-square label; date + UTC time
  use the same 2-row layout as every other telemetry stack (#1583).

**Sweep 2 — 5 small bug fixes (#2272)**
- Double-clicking an off-screen slice indicator (`<A` / `A>`) recenters
  cleanly without retuning to a wrong frequency (#2237).  Qt's
  press → release → double-click → release sequence was leaving
  `m_spotClickConsumed=false` on the trailing release, so the
  single-click-to-tune path fired against the new center.
- HAVE_RADE without HAVE_WEBSOCKETS compile error (#2204) —
  `startFreeDvReporting` / `stopFreeDvReporting` now wrap their
  bodies with `#ifndef HAVE_WEBSOCKETS` no-op fallback.
- (See "Features" above for #1846 spot mode, #1993 ATU toggle, #2259
  custom filter edges.)

## [v0.9.4] — 2026-05-01

### AetherSweep, ShackSwitch, and multi-client startup hardening

A heavy community-contribution release.  Headline feature is **AetherSweep**
(jensenpat) — an in-panadapter SWR sweep analyzer that walks the current TX
band, plots SWR live on the spectrum surface, and handles TGXL bypass +
external-amplifier safety.  **ShackSwitch** support (nigelfenton) lands as a
new Peripherals tab + dedicated applet, integrating any builder's open-source
Arduino antenna switch over the Antenna Genius protocol.

A trio of substantial reliability fixes from jensenpat addresses long-standing
multi-client startup issues — when SmartSDR or DAX is already connected,
AetherSDR's panadapter creation, slice ownership, and PC audio stream
acquisition now all hold up under the racey status interleavings the
ShackSwitch and DAX users were hitting.  Plus a focused mix of platform
fixes: macOS DMG dark-theme on pop-out windows (Chaosuk97), Windows
without-Qt6::SerialPort build (NF0T), NRL gating correctness on 6000-series
radios.

### Features

**AetherSweep — in-panadapter SWR analyzer (#2202, #2220, #2230, jensenpat)**
- New Start/Clear Sweep buttons under the ANT slice menu, plus a 1-10 W
  sweep-power slider with cross-panel sync.  Persisted as
  `SwrSweepPowerWatts` and defaults to 1 W.
- Walks the current TX band stepping a tune carrier in 20 kHz increments
  with edge guards, sampling fresh SWR + forward-power meter data per step,
  and overlays the curve on the panadapter directly under the slice flag.
- Per-band-edge guard, max-260-points cap, and 60 m channelized-band
  refusal.  Refuses to start when split is active, when transmitting,
  when the band is wider than the radio's max pan width, or when a PGXL
  amplifier is in OPERATE mode (forces user to STANDBY first).
- ⚠️  **Third-party amplifiers are not auto-detected.** AetherSweep
  only knows how to put a Power Genius XL into standby — it has no way
  to talk to ACOM, SPE, Elecraft KPA, OM Power, or other linear amps.
  **If you have a non-PGXL amplifier, manually place it in BYPASS or
  STANDBY before starting an SWR sweep.**  The sweep will run a tune
  carrier through whatever path the radio sees, and a non-bypassed
  external linear will amplify that carrier into your antenna.
- Full TGXL handling: snapshots OPERATE/BYPASS state, places TGXL into
  BYPASS to read raw antenna SWR, restores original state on completion
  or abort.  Reads radio-side SWR while TGXL is bypassed (TGXL stops
  emitting RL meter packets in bypass — #2229).
- 5-phase state machine with explicit timeouts: WaitingForTgxlBypass,
  TgxlBypassSettle, Sweeping, StoppingTune, RestoringTgxl.
- Esc to abort.  Inputs locked during sweep so the user can't accidentally
  retune mid-pass.  Disconnect mid-sweep cleanly stops the carrier and
  releases TGXL.
- Optimistic `setTunePower()` update so the sweep's chosen power lands
  immediately rather than racing the radio's status echo.
- Sweep result label shows source — `RADIO` for direct measurement,
  `TGXL BYPASS` for tuner-bypassed measurement.

**ShackSwitch antenna switch integration (#2214, #2227, nigelfenton)**
- New **Peripherals** tab in Radio Setup with auto-discovery and manual-IP
  connect for ShackSwitch devices via the Antenna Genius (AG) UDP/TCP
  protocol on port 9007.
- New **ShackSwitchApplet** — compact panel with up to 8 labelled
  antenna-port buttons, click-to-switch, active-port highlight.  SO2R
  dual-radio mode shows Input A / Input B side-by-side with conflict
  detection.  Single-radio mode (4-port R4 hardware) hides Input B
  automatically.
- Dummy-load / deselect (clicking the active port deselects it) and
  per-port labels driven by the device's own configuration.
- Integration is invisible to users without ShackSwitch hardware —
  detected by the `name="ShackSwitch"` field in the AG broadcast beacon.
- Web UI launcher button opens the device's local web interface.
- Reference hardware: ShackSwitch v2.0 (Arduino Uno Q, SO2R, 8-port) and
  ShackSwitch R4 (Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, single-radio, 4-port).

### Bug fixes

**Multi-client startup panadapter creation (#2222, jensenpat)**
- AetherSDR's startup pan creation now holds up cleanly when SmartSDR,
  DAX, or another GUI/audio client is already connected.  The radio
  replays status for all current pans/slices/streams on connect; without
  this fix, AetherSDR could correctly reject other clients' objects but
  then fail to instantiate its own `PanadapterModel` if ownership status
  arrived out of order.
- Adds `display panafall create x=100 y=100` (FlexLib v4.2.18 syntax)
  with capability-based fallback to legacy `panadapter create`.
- New `ensureOwnedPanadapter()` factory; deferred-status replay queue
  for `display pan` frames that arrive without `client_handle`; waterfall
  ordering recovery via `panadapter=...` parent ID lookup.
- Routes failure cases through the existing `panadapterLimitReached` /
  `sliceCreateFailed` status-bar signals so radio resource exhaustion
  is visible instead of looking like a startup hang.

**PC audio remote stream ownership (#2226, jensenpat)**
- Fixes PC Audio failure when SmartSDR / DAX is already running — the
  shared `remote_audio_rx` pipe was being silently removed because
  AetherSDR was parsing the `stream create` response body as decimal
  instead of hex.  `"4000009"` (no `0x` prefix) was becoming
  `0x003D0F09` instead of `0x04000009`, so the create-response stream
  didn't match the status-reported stream and AetherSDR removed the
  real one.
- Extracts a new `RadioStatusOwnership` helper (header-only, fully
  unit-tested) that handles ownership decisions for both panadapters
  and remote audio streams — defer when no `client_handle`, claim
  when ours, ignore when another client's.
- Stream-acquisition state machine now tracks create-pending,
  remove-requested, and adopted-from-status separately so toggling
  PC Audio doesn't race the create response.
- Adds `radio_status_ownership_test` with 25 assertions covering all
  the ownership decisions and the headline parse bug.
- Fixes #2037, #1418, #1473.

**TGXL meter goes silent during bypass (#2229, #2230)**
- AetherSweep aborted with "no fresh TGXL SWR meter data" whenever the
  TGXL was in OPERATE before sweep start.  The TGXL stops emitting `RL`
  (return-loss) meter packets while in BYPASS — bypass relays are
  passive wire-through, no measurement engine.
- Switches the meter source to RADIO while the TGXL is bypassed; the
  radio's own SWR coupler measures the same physical signal through
  the bypassed relays.  UI label still shows `TGXL BYPASS` since
  that's what describes the configuration.

**Pop-out applet panel white background on macOS (#2190, Chaosuk97)**
- macOS DMG builds rendered floating windows with a white background
  even though the dark-theme stylesheet was applied — the CI-built
  `libqcocoa.dylib` enforced `Qt::WA_StyledBackground` more strictly
  than Homebrew's Qt 6.11.0 build.
- Adds `setAttribute(Qt::WA_StyledBackground, true)` on all three
  floating-window classes (`FloatingContainerWindow`, `PanFloatingWindow`,
  `MainWindow::floatAppletPanel`).  Cross-platform safe: the attribute
  is harmless on Linux/Windows where it was a no-op, and now the
  pop-out applet panel correctly themed on every platform (was
  defaulting to system theme on Linux/Windows too — latent bug fixed
  as a side effect).

**Windows build without Qt6::SerialPort (#2195, NF0T)**
- Compile error introduced by #2147: the `<QElapsedTimer>` include was
  guarded by `#ifdef HAVE_SERIALPORT` while `m_debounceTimer` is declared
  under `#if defined(HAVE_SERIALPORT) || defined(Q_OS_WIN)`.  Mismatch
  broke the Windows-without-SerialPort build configuration.  Widens the
  include guard to match.

**NRL DSP filter visible on 6000-series radios (#2219)**
- Fixes regression from #2184 where NRL was incorrectly grouped with
  the 8000-series-only firmware DSP filters (NRS, RNN, NRF).  NRL is
  available on 6000-series too — only NRS/RNN/NRF require BigBend /
  DragonFire hardware.  Fixes #2198.

## [v0.9.3] — 2026-04-30

### External APD, FreeDV Reporter, Slice Colors, and v4.2 firmware updater

A broad release.  Headline feature is **External APD** support for
SmartSDR firmware 4.2.18, which lets the radio sample its outgoing
RF from a coupled feedback path on one of the RX/XVTR inputs so the
predistortion engine trains against the actual transmitted signal —
required when a FLEX-8x00 drives an external linear amplifier.
**FreeDV Reporter** station reporting (NF0T) lands the long-requested
RADE-integrated reporting flow.  **chibondking** ships customizable
slice colors plus two serial / pop-out fixes.  AetherSDR's firmware
updater is rewritten to extract `.ssdr` files natively from
FlexRadio's v4.2+ MSI installer (no bundled tools needed), and the
NAVTEX data-layer plumbing lands ahead of the upcoming applet.

A long tail of UI polish and Windows-platform fixes also lands —
TX→RX waterfall continuity, scroll-wheel debounce, 48 kHz audio
sink on Windows, applet pop-out persistence, and floating-window
dark theming.

### Features

**External APD (#2187)**
- New "APD" tab in Radio Setup with per-TX-antenna external sampler
  selection (ANT1 / ANT2 / XVTA / XVTB → INTERNAL / RX_A / RX_B /
  XVTA / XVTB).  Tab is hidden unless the radio reports `apd
  configurable=1`, so it stays invisible on 6000-series radios and
  pre-4.2.18 firmware.
- Equalizer Reset button issues `apd reset` to clear all per-antenna
  training data.
- Protocol additions: `apd sampler` sub-object parsing (with
  fallback-to-INTERNAL for invalid `selected_sampler`), bare
  `equalizer_reset` flag handling, and the matching `setApdSamplerPort`
  command path on `TransmitModel`.
- Cross-checked against `Flex.Smoothlake.FlexLib` v4.2.18 source.

**FreeDV Reporter station reporting with RADE integration (#2173, NF0T)**
- Adds FreeDV Reporter (https://qso.freedv.org) station-reporting
  support driven by the RADE modem's sync / SNR / freq-offset events.
- New connection toggle in the DX Cluster dialog plus per-slice
  reporting toggle that mirrors RADE engine state to the Reporter
  WebSocket session.
- Builds opportunistically — without `Qt6::WebSockets` or `librade`,
  the toggles silently become no-ops.

**Customizable slice colors (#2155, chibondking)**
- Per-slice color selection through a new `SliceColorManager`
  singleton.  Color assignments persist across sessions and are
  visible in VFO widgets, panadapter overlays, and meter strips.

**Native MSI firmware installer support (#2169)**
- The firmware updater can now extract `.ssdr` files directly from
  FlexRadio's v4.2.18+ MSI installer (which switched from PE/COFF
  self-extracting `.exe` to WiX 6 MSI).  Vendored `libmspack`
  (LGPL-2.1) handles LZX-compressed CABs; a small OLE Compound File
  reader pulls the embedded CAB from the MSI envelope.
- "Browse .ssdr" → "Select Installer..." now accepts `.msi`, `.exe`,
  and `.ssdr`.  No external tools required (no `7z`, no MSI runtime).
- Format auto-detection on the first 8 bytes (OLE magic vs. PE/COFF MZ).

**NAVTEX data-layer plumbing (#2186)**
- New `NavtexModel` covers the SmartSDR `navtex` waveform protocol —
  per-message Pending → Queued → Sent / Error state, status parsing
  for `navtex` and `navtex sent`, and a `navtex send` command path
  with proper quote/backslash escaping for `msg_text`.
- Foundation for the upcoming NAVTEX applet UI; data layer ships
  first so other clients (TCI, scripting) can already publish NAVTEX
  traffic.
- 21-assertion unit test covers escaping, idempotency, error paths.

**CWX active tracking (#2181)**
- `RadioModel` tracks CWX send state so the audio gate stays open
  during long character sends.

**Floating-window dark theme (#2096, AetherClaude)**
- Pop-out panadapter and floating-container windows now inherit the
  full dark theme via a new `Theme.h` shared stylesheet, eliminating
  flash-of-light-theme on window construction.

**Center active VFO when zooming in from keyboard (#2183, jensenpat)**
- The keyboard zoom-in shortcut now centers the active VFO in the
  viewport (matches the mouse-wheel zoom behavior).

### Bug fixes

**TX→RX waterfall continuity (#2171, #2182)**
- Force FFT-fallback rendering on TX→RX transition to prevent a
  visible gap in the waterfall (#2171).
- Blank waterfall rows for 400 ms after TX ends so any residual
  hardware tail doesn't paint over the noise floor (#2182).

**Hide 8000-series DSP filters on 6000-series radios (#2184)**
- `NRL`, `NRS`, `RNN`, `NRF` filters are FLEX-8x00-only.  6000-series
  radios no longer show greyed-out controls for filters they can't
  use.

**Stream-status helper consolidation (#2145)**
- Deduplicates the per-stream-type status helpers.  Annotates
  `m_daxTxClientHandle` and documents the TCI receiver-index policy
  for future contributors.

**TCP close handshake before socket destroy (#2113)**
- Wait for `disconnected()` before tearing down the QTcpSocket on
  user-initiated disconnect.  Fixes occasional "connection reset"
  reports on the radio side.

**rigctld short-form split direction (#2111)**
- `S` (set split) and `s` (get split) were transposed in the rigctld
  mapping table, so external loggers couldn't read or set split.

**CW sidetone on Windows (#2105)**
- `startSidetoneStream()` was never called on Windows because the
  audio backend init order put it after the first key event.  CW
  sidetone now starts immediately on connect.

**48 kHz RX audio sink on Windows (#2123)**
- Prefer 48 kHz over 24 kHz on Windows where WASAPI's resampler
  introduces audible high-frequency artifacts at 24 kHz.

**Scrollbar styling on applet panels (#2088)**
- The applet-panel scroll area was inheriting Qt's default thin grey
  scrollbar; restyles to the dark-theme bar.

**USB mic level gauge on connect (#2086)**
- The USB mic-level gauge wasn't drawn when connecting with `mic
  source = PC`; gauge now appears immediately.

**VOX phoneStateChanged on keyboard shortcut (#2084)**
- VOX setters didn't emit `phoneStateChanged()`, so the UI didn't
  refresh when VOX was toggled via keyboard shortcut.

**Scroll-wheel debounce (#2151)**
- Debounces high-frequency `pixelDelta` scroll events from
  precision-scroll mice in `VfoWidget` and `SpectrumWidget`.

**Marker-width settings cleanup (#2156, mvanhorn)**
- `Slice<N>_MarkerThin` setting key is now removed after migration
  to `Slice<N>_MarkerWidth` instead of being left in place.

**Serial PTT — Win32 WaitCommEvent path (#2147, chibondking)**
- FTDI VCP drivers only refresh DSR/CTS in the completion of a
  `WaitCommEvent` call; AetherSDR's polling-based detection missed
  edges on Windows.  Adds a Win32 native event-wait path on top of
  Qt's serial port for DSR detection.

**Applet pop-out persistence race (#2154, chibondking)**
- Floating applet windows were sometimes restored at the wrong
  position because the geometry-save signal raced the close event.
  Systemic fix wires save before destruction.

**Windows build guard for FreeDV Reporter (#2186)**
- The FreeDV Reporter `freedvReportingToggled` connect-lambda used
  RADE-guarded symbols inside an `#ifdef HAVE_WEBSOCKETS` block.
  Windows has WebSockets but no RADE → undefined-identifier compile
  errors.  Added the missing `HAVE_RADE` inner guard.

### Docs

- **Data-modes help refresh (#1939)** — replaces lingering "DIGI
  applet" references with the current independent-tile UI vocabulary.
- **DIGI applet scrub (#2179)** — sweeps the remaining stale
  references in tooltips and dialog text.

integration; **chibondking** for slice colors, the serial PTT
WaitCommEvent fix, and the applet pop-out race; **jensenpat** for

## [v0.9.2.1] — 2026-04-29

### TGXL direct autotune for firmware 4.2 compatibility

Hotfix release.  After upgrading to SmartSDR firmware 4.2, multiple
users on both AetherSDR and SmartSDR report the TUNE button no longer
works on the 4O3A Tuner Genius XL.  The radio's `tgxl autotune` command
path was reworked in 4.2 firmware and broke for many configurations.

This release routes the TUNE button through the TGXL's native
port-9010 channel when a direct TGXL connection is configured,
bypassing the affected firmware path.  Users without a direct TGXL
connection are unaffected by this change and should still configure
direct connection in Radio Setup → Tuner to recover TUNE.

### Bug Fixes

**TGXL TUNE works again on firmware 4.2 (#2163)**
- When a direct TGXL connection (port 9010) is configured, the TUNE
  button now sends the native `autotune` command directly to the TGXL
  instead of routing `tgxl autotune handle=<H>` through the radio's
  command channel.  Falls back to the radio path when no direct
  connection is available.
- The TGXL drives radio PTT via its hardware interlock cable when it
  receives the native `autotune` command, so client-side keying is
  not required.  Existing tuning state and SWR readout in the Tuner
  applet are unchanged.

**Log redaction no longer mangles 4-component version strings**
- The PII redactor's IPv4 regex matched anything that looked like
  four dot-separated 1-3-digit numbers, so the application's own
  version string `0.9.2.1` was being redacted to `*.*.*. 1` in
  logs and support bundles.  Negative lookbehind/lookahead now skip
  quoted (`"0.9.2.1"`) and v-prefixed (`v0.9.2.1`) version forms
  while still redacting bare IPs in log output.

## [v0.9.2] — 2026-04-28

### WAVE Phase 2, v4.2.18 firmware support, and community polish

A focused community-driven release.  Major work from **jensenpat** lands
the WAVE Phase 2 applet (four visualizations, settings drawer), proper
TCXO frequency-offset calibration, and the DAX/TCI multi-stream routing
needed for FlexRadio firmware 4.2.18.  **chibondking** and **NF0T**
ship a serial PTT fix and an r8b heap-corruption crash fix.  The VFO
DSP panel gets a UX pass (collapsed Marker + Filter Edge buttons), and
the v4.2.18 discovery beacon is parsed.

### Features

**WAVE Phase 2 — applet visualization controls (#2124, jensenpat)**
- Double-click the WAVE waveform to open a settings drawer (replaces
  the prior clear-on-double-click behavior).  Drawer is open by default
  on first launch for discoverability.
- New compact `View` dropdown with four visualizations:
  Scope (the original waveform trace), Envelope (filled RMS with peak
  outline), History (side-scrolling activity bars), Bands (vertical
  EQ-style frequency bands).
- Persisted Zoom and FPS controls in the drawer.  Zoom is amplitude
  gain across all views, not a time-window preference.
- Drawer participates in the applet size hint when expanded so the
  applet stays compact when collapsed.

**DAX-aware TCI multi-stream routing (#2140, jensenpat)**
- Adapts the DAX/TCI audio path for FlexRadio firmware 4.2.18's
  explicit stream-ownership reporting.  Filters DAX RX/IQ stream
  status by `client_handle` so we don't accidentally register another
  client's stream, while accepting ownership-less status from older
  firmware.
- Advertises TCI receivers as contiguous owned-slice indexes
  (`0..N-1`) rather than raw Flex slice IDs.  Fixes WSJT-X TCI1/TCI2
  multi-slice operation when this client owns slice 1 but another
  client owns slice 0.
- Honors per-client `audio_start:<receiver>` so multi-slice WSJT-X
  receives only the intended audio.
- Stream-removal handling: unregisters DAX/IQ streams and clears TCI
  DAX placeholders on `removed` status.
- Adds focused diagnostics for first DAX VITA packets, TCI receiver
  maps, DAX RX delivery, and DAX TX route selection — gated behind
  `lcDax` / `lcCat` categories so default users see no extra noise.

**TCXO frequency-offset calibration (#2119, jensenpat)**
- Replaces the unsupported `radio calibrate` command (firmware
  v4.1.5 returns `0x50000016` "unknown command") with the documented
  SmartSDR / FlexLib sequence: `radio set cal_freq=`, `radio set
  freq_error_ppb=0`, `radio pll_start`.
- Watches `pll_done` status for completion with run-specific guards
  against stale events from a prior calibration firing during a new
  run.
- Cross-checked against FlexLib v2.10.1 source.  Fixes #1237, #2095.

**VFO marker controls — tri-state Marker, single Filter Edge (#2141)**
- The four-button row (Thin / Thick / Edges / Hide) collapses to two:
  - **Marker** cycles `Off → 1 px → 3 px` on click.  Off skips both
    the center line and the top triangle, leaving only the passband
    bracket.
  - **Filter Edge** is a checkable on/off — checked = edges shown.
- New `Slice<N>_MarkerWidth` int settings key with one-shot migration
  from the old `Slice<N>_MarkerThin` bool (`True` → 1, `False` → 3).

**v4.2.18 discovery beacon parsing (#2138, AetherClaude)**
- Parses two new fields from the FlexLib v4.2.18 discovery packet:
  `is_system_model` (flags bench / system-build radios) and
  `turf_region` (turf region indicator distinct from the existing
  `region` field).  `turf_region` is shown in the connect dialog
  detail line.

**Other**
- ATU start added to the keyboard shortcut actions list.
- Clear action added to the CW decode window context menu (#2116).

### Bug fixes

**Resampler heap corruption (#2114, NF0T)**
- `r8b::CDSPResampler24::process()` doesn't bounds-check its `l`
  parameter; passing a block larger than the constructor's
  `aMaxInLen` silently overflows internal filter buffers.  Bug
  manifested as a crash when the Qt event loop stalled long enough
  for `QAudioSource::readAll()` to return more than 4096 frames in
  one call (typical during DX-cluster spot bursts or heavy UI
  redraws).  Fix: chunk-and-recurse on each `process*()` path so each
  call stays within the configured limit.

**Serial PTT input non-functional (#2125, chibondking)**
- Three layered bugs blocked the serial-PTT path:
  1. No way to open the port without restarting AetherSDR — the
     Serial tab had no Open / Close buttons and the auto-open label
     implied a restart was required.
  2. `loadSettings()` defaulted CTS / DSR polarity to `ActiveLow`
     while the dialog combo defaulted to "Active High".  Users who
     left polarity at the displayed default got silently inverted
     logic — footswitch press read as inactive, PTT never fired.
  3. `updatePolling()` was missed when the port was opened, so the
     polling loop didn't pick up the configured input function.
- Adds Open / Close buttons to the Serial tab, fixes the polarity
  default mismatch, and tracks the explicit Open state separately
  from auto-open via a new `SerialPortOpen` setting.

**Slice audio loss after band changes (#2128, jensenpat)**
- After `display pan set band=`, the radio sometimes stops mixing
  slice audio without echoing `audio_mute=1`, leaving the model in a
  "unmuted but silent" state.  Fix: 300 ms after the band-change
  command, reassert `slice set <N> audio_mute=0` for any unmuted
  slice on that pan.

**CWX Live toggle and Send action (#2122, jensenpat)**
- `Live` button is now a true toggle so operators can turn live
  keying back off (was force-on only).
- `Send` button now submits the current input when Live is off
  (matching Enter-key behavior).
- Setup exits Live cleanly without duplicate-sending text already
  keyed character-by-character.
- Adds `cwx_panel_test` covering Live toggling, Send-click
  submission, Enter submission, and Live exit safety.

**Connect-radio dialog grouping polish (#2121, jensenpat)**
- Scopes the `QFrame` callout stylesheet so child labels and
  checkboxes don't inherit the panel border / background, fixing
  nested-bordered-box rendering on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Tightens the SmartLink Remote radio list height and moves the
  Connect Remote button outside the Remote group.

### Internal

- `bool m_markerThin` → `int m_markerWidth` (0 / 1 / 3) propagated
  through `VfoWidget`, `SpectrumWidget::SliceOverlay`, and the
  `markerStyleChanged` signal.  Render path skips both the center
  line and the top triangle when `markerWidth == 0`.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to **jensenpat** for the WAVE Phase 2, DAX/TCI, calibration,
band-change, CWX, and dialog polish work; **chibondking** for the
serial PTT triple-fix; and **NF0T** for catching the r8b heap-
corruption bug.

## [v0.9.1] — 2026-04-27

### Local iambic CW keyer, unified sidetone controls, and CW transmit reliability

A focused follow-up to v0.9.0.  The headline feature is a software
iambic keyer that turns any MIDI / serial paddle into a sub-5 ms
sidetone source via the new PortAudio backend (issue #2079) — the
radio still produces the on-air signal, but the local sidetone
gate fires the moment the paddle moves instead of waiting for the
radio's keyed-back signal.  Three latent bugs in the netcw protocol
path that prevented CW from ever transmitting on FLEX-8600 v4.1.5
firmware are also fixed.  Plus the CW panel collapses three sidetone
widget groups into one set of controls and finally wires up the L/R
pan slider that's been a placeholder since the panel was first added.

### Features

**Local iambic keyer for sub-5 ms paddle sidetone (#2079)**
- Software iambic state machine that runs alongside the radio's RF
  iambic engine.  Both engines see the same paddle inputs at the same
  WPM and produce identical Morse timing — but the local keyer drives
  the sidetone gate directly, avoiding the 50–200 ms round-trip
  through the radio's keyed-back signal.
- Modes A and B implemented (Ultimatic / Bug / Straight follow in a
  later phase).  Hooked into both MIDI Gate params (`cw.dit`,
  `cw.dah`) and serial paddle paths (DTR/CTS via SerialPortController).
- Driven by the existing radio Iambic toggle — no new UI clutter.
  The keyer mirrors the radio's iambic state, mode, and WPM via the
  TransmitModel `phoneStateChanged` signal.
- Dedicated worker thread with `std::chrono::steady_clock` timing
  and a lock-free atomic key gate on the audio side.  9 unit tests
  covering single dit/dah timing, squeeze alternation, inter-element
  gap, mode A release behaviour, WPM scaling, paddle swap, idempotent
  start, and idle behaviour.

**Sidetone controls unified (#2079)**
- The CW panel previously had three separate sidetone widget groups:
  the radio's "Sidetone" toggle/volume, a "Local STn" toggle/volume
  for the local PortAudio sidetone, and a "Follow" pitch row with a
  manual override slider.  All three are now collapsed into the
  single existing **Sidetone** button, which drives both engines in
  lockstep.  The volume slider drives `mon_gain_cw` on the radio and
  the local sidetone identically.  Pitch always follows the radio's
  `cw_pitch`.

**CW pan slider wired up (#2079)**
- The L/R pan slider in the CW panel was a dead UI element with a
  TODO comment.  Now drives both the radio's `mon_pan_cw` (radio-side
  sidetone pan within the RX audio stream) and the local sidetone
  with constant-power pan law (cosine/sine for equal-loudness sweep,
  no center dip).  Double-click on the slider recenters to 50.

**Slice capacity notification (#48)**
- Status-bar warning when adding another panadapter would exceed the
  radio's slice limit.  Three guard points cover the pre-flight check
  in the layout dialog, the runtime check in `applyPanLayout`, and
  the async fallback when the radio rejects a `panafall create`.
  Includes the radio model name and slice count in the message.

**PortAudio sidetone via JACK on Linux (#2075 follow-up)**
- The PortAudio sidetone backend (introduced in v0.9.0) now prefers
  the JACK host API on Linux when available, with `paFramesPerBuffer
  = 128` + `suggestedLatency = 0` for sub-5 ms quantum.  PipeWire's
  ALSA shim silently breaks callback-mode streams on some setups
  (`Pa_StartStream` returns success but the audio thread never
  schedules the callback); pipewire-jack delivers reliable callbacks
  at the device's native sample rate.  48 kHz is now the universal
  preference, with `Pa_IsFormatSupported` guarding fallback.

### Bug fixes

**CW transmit: invalid paddle command form**
- `RadioModel::sendCwPaddle` was emitting `cw key 1 0` (a 2-arg paddle
  form) which the radio's protocol does not accept — FlexLib only
  ever sends single-state `cw key 1` or `cw key 0` and expects the
  client to do iambic timing locally.  The 2-arg form was silently
  dropped, so paddle keying produced no RF.  Now collapses to a
  straight-key form when the local iambic keyer isn't running, or
  routes through the new `sendCwKeyEdge` + `sendCwPtt` primitives
  when it is.

**CW transmit: lowercase hex in netcw payload**
- FlexLib formats `time=0x...` and `client_handle=0x...` with C#
  `ToString("X")` (uppercase), and the radio's status messages do
  too (e.g. `S23A59BDF|...`).  Firmware v4.1.5's netcw parser is
  case-sensitive on these fields and silently dropped lowercase
  packets.  Now formatted explicitly uppercase.

**CW transmit: dead TCP fallback**
- The post-UDP TCP fallback was sending the netcw-decorated form
  (`cw key 1 time=0x... index=... client_handle=0x...`) which the
  radio rejects with `0x50001000` ("command syntax error") on TCP.
  Removed when the netcw stream is up; the no-netcw fallback (for
  firmware that doesn't support netcw stream creation) is preserved
  separately.

**Optimistic updates for CW model setters**
- `setCwIambic`, `setCwIambicMode`, `setCwSpeed`, and `setCwPitch`
  on `TransmitModel` previously sent the command to the radio
  without updating local state, on the assumption that the radio
  would echo the new value back.  Firmware v1.4.0.0 doesn't reliably
  echo iambic flags, WPM, or pitch in transmit status messages, so
  any code reading these properties after a UI toggle saw stale
  values until the next periodic transmit status arrived (or never).
  Now follow the same optimistic-update pattern as `setCwBreakIn`.

**Block on graceful disconnect (#1996, openstreem)**
- `RadioModel::disconnectFromRadio` now uses `Qt::BlockingQueued
  Connection` for both the `gracefulDisconnect` lambda and the
  fallback `disconnectFromRadio` call, matching the destructor's
  pattern.  Without this, the queued work could be cancelled before
  it ran during app teardown — leaving the radio with a stale
  session that required a power cycle.

**Memory recall: restore repeater offset and tone (#1871, #1965, jensenpat)**
- Recalled FM repeater memories properly restore `repeater_offset_dir`,
  `fm_repeater_offset_freq`, derived `tx_offset_freq`, and CTCSS tone
  state.  Previously, switching from a repeater memory to simplex
  could leave stale TX offset state on the slice.

**`m_activeTxSlice` initializer mismatch (#2076)**
- Default-init was `0` but `clear()` sets to `-1`.  Now both default
  to `-1` so a fresh `MeterModel` and a cleared one have identical
  `activeTxSlice()` state.

**Per-slice compression meter resolution (#2073)**
- TX-chain `COMPPEAK`, `AFTEREQ`, and `SC_MIC` meters are now
  resolved per active slice instead of last-match-wins, fixing
  Multi-Flex setups where the wrong slice's compression value was
  surfaced in the UI.

**ContainerWidget restoreState displaces children**
- `restoreState` re-inserted children at indices 0..N–1 even when
  they were already in the layout, displacing non-saved children
  like the CHAIN widget.  `insertChildWidget` is now a no-op when
  the child is already present.

### Build and CI

- `M_PI_2` replaced with a local `kPiOver2` constexpr in
  `CwSidetoneGenerator.cpp` so the Windows MSVC build doesn't
  fail (`<cmath>` doesn't define `M_PI_2` without `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`).

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to the operators who tested CW workflows on real hardware
and surfaced the netcw protocol issues that had been silent since
the netcw backend landed, and to **jensenpat** and **openstreem**
for the community fixes bundled in.

## [v0.9.0] — 2026-04-25

### Aetherial RX Audio Suite, frameless UI, and local CW sidetone

A milestone release. The PooDoo Audio chain — Aetherial Parametric EQ,
AGC-T gate, AGC-C compressor, Tube saturator, and PUDU exciter — now
runs on **both** RX and TX with independent settings, drag-to-reorder
on each path, and matching frameless editor windows.  The whole UI
goes frameless: the main window plus every applet pop-out and editor
gets a Discord-style minimise / maximise / close trio with title-bar
drag.  CW operators get a dedicated low-latency local sidetone sink
that survives CWX too.  Plus community fixes for the FLEX-6000
compression meter, RTTY mark-default reset, RADE decoded audio, and
the usual stack of UX polish.

### Features

**PooDoo Audio RX chain (#1998)**
- Reuses the existing TX DSP modules (Parametric EQ, gate/expander,
  compressor, tube saturator, PUDU exciter) on the RX path with
  fully independent state from TX.  Each stage is a tile in the
  CHAIN widget on the RX side: single-click toggles bypass,
  double-click opens the floating editor.  RX chain order is
  drag-to-reorder.  RADIO and SPEAK status tiles bookend the chain;
  the DSP tile shows whichever client-side noise reducer is active
  (NR2 / NR4 / BNR).
- All applet titles rebrand to **Aetherial**: Parametric EQ,
  AGC-T (gate), AGC-C (compressor), Tube, PUDU.

**Frameless main window with custom title bar (#1926)**
- Main window now uses `Qt::FramelessWindowHint` with a custom
  20 px title bar carrying drag-to-move via `startSystemMove`,
  double-click maximise, and a Discord-style minimise / maximise /
  close trio.  Resize via standard window-edge grip.

**Frameless pop-out windows for applets and panadapters (#1922)**
- Every floating applet and panadapter pop-out gains the same
  frameless title bar with the trio.  Single-click trio actions,
  drag the bar to move, double-click to maximise.

**Frameless editor windows for the entire PooDoo chain (#1998)**
- Aetherial Parametric EQ, AGC-T, AGC-C, Tube, PUDU, and Reverb
  editors all use the same shared title-bar widget with drag and
  trio.  Title text reads "Aetherial &lt;Stage&gt; — &lt;Side&gt;" so the
  TX vs RX instance is identifiable at a glance.

**Polish frameless title bar (#1931)**
- Title-bar trio refined to a Discord-style sequence; dropped the
  lightbulb icon in favour of a minimal arrow accent so the trio
  sits flush against the right edge.

**Local CW sidetone with low-latency sink + CWX support (#1969)**
- Dedicated low-latency local sidetone path that bypasses the
  protocol-level monitor for keying feedback that doesn't fight
  network jitter.  Works for paddle, straight key, and CWX
  generated transmissions.  Pitch and gain follow the existing
  `pitch` / `mon_gain_cw` controls.

**Two-Tone Tune shortcut (#1995, jensenpat)**
- New unassigned `Two-Tone Tune` keyboard action under the TX
  shortcut category.  Sends `transmit set tune_mode=two_tone`
  before starting Tune, toggles off on a second press, and
  restores `tune_mode=single_tone` on stop so the regular TUNE
  press isn't surprised by sticky two-tone state.

**XVTR diagnostic logging (#1964)**
- New `xvtr` logging category captures status messages, RF↔IF
  frequency translation, and pan-bandwidth conversions so XVTR
  setup issues can be diagnosed from log bundles instead of pcap.

**XVTR policy regression tests (#1960)**
- Test harness covers transverter active/inactive state, RF↔IF
  conversion, and the family of pan-recenter cases that used to
  drop the waterfall when crossing IF/RF boundaries.

### Bug fixes

**Flex compression meter derivation across radio families (#1992, jensenpat)**
- FLEX-8000 series exposes `TX/AFTEREQ` at 20 fps as the post-EQ
  reference for compression display; FLEX-6000 captures don't
  expose `AFTEREQ`, so the best matching reference is `TX/SC_MIC`
  at 10 fps with `TX/COMPPEAK` still at 20 fps.  Mixed cadence is
  guarded by a freshness check so a fresh `COMPPEAK` isn't compared
  against a stale `SC_MIC` sample.  When `AFTEREQ` is present it
  takes precedence over `SC_MIC`.

**Preserve rtty_mark_default when radio resets mark on band change (#1968, chibondking)**
- The radio resets `slice rtty_mark` to 2125 in the status broadcast
  that follows a band change, regardless of the configured
  `rtty_mark_default`.  `SliceModel::applyStatus()` was accepting
  the 2125 value blindly, overwriting the user's configured mark.
  Now tracks `m_rttyMarkDefault` (seeded from `RadioModel`) and a
  user-override flag so the correct default is pushed back when
  the radio resets, without fighting an intentional 2125 selection.

**Fix choppy/harsh RADE decoded audio: dedicated buffer + sample-wise mix (#1953, NF0T)**
- RADE decoded audio was sharing the SSB output buffer, producing
  glitches and harsh artefacts on decoded voice.  Split into a
  dedicated buffer with per-sample mixing into the speaker output
  so RADE and SSB don't fight for the same write window.

**Fix CoreMIDI init crash during MIDI auto-connect (#1949, jensenpat)**
- macOS CoreMIDI initialisation could crash on launch when
  auto-connect ran before the MIDI client was fully constructed.
  Init order tightened so the client is ready before any
  auto-connect attempt.

**Restore shortcuts after slider nudges (#1952, jensenpat)**
- Shortcut bindings could go stale after the user nudged a slider
  with the keyboard, because focus stayed on the slider and ate
  subsequent shortcut keystrokes.  Focus now returns to the main
  window after a slider nudge.

**Preserve MIDI bindings when saving device settings (#1951, jensenpat)**
- Saving MIDI device settings was overwriting bindings with an
  empty map because the save path read from the wrong source.
  Now the existing binding map is merged into the saved settings.

**Cancel frequency entry with Escape (#1954, jensenpat)**
- The numeric frequency-entry buffer didn't honour Escape, so a
  user who started typing a frequency had to clear the buffer
  manually.  Escape now cancels the entry cleanly.

**Gate XVTR waterfall tile shifts (#1925, jensenpat)**
- Waterfall tile-shift logic continued to fire on XVTR pans even
  when the IF↔RF frequency relationship made the shift meaningless,
  producing visual tearing.  Shifts are now gated on transverter
  state.

**Close all floating windows when main window closes (#1920, chibondking)**
- Floating applet pop-outs and panadapter pop-outs were left as
  orphaned top-level windows when the main window was closed,
  forcing the user to close each one individually.  All
  floating children now close together with the main window.

### Build and CI

**cmake: declare Qt 6.2 minimum (#1962)**
- `startSystemMove` is gated behind Qt 6.2; the build now declares
  the minimum explicitly so older systems get a clean configure
  error rather than a confusing link failure.  Matches Ubuntu
  22.04 LTS shipped Qt.

**ci(windows): switch to Ninja so sccache actually wraps cl.exe (#1963)**
- The Windows CI job was using MSBuild, which sccache can't wrap
  for compilation caching.  Moved to Ninja so the sccache layer
  established in #1913 actually has effect, cutting Windows build
  times further.

**ci: speed up Windows build with sccache + Qt/FFTW caching (#1913)**
- Adds sccache for compiler caching plus GitHub Actions cache
  layers for Qt and FFTW dependencies.  First-run pulls populate
  the cache; subsequent CI runs reuse compiled objects and prebuilt
  third-party artefacts.

**Add /bigobj to MSVC compile options (#1910 → #1911)**
- The compilation unit hit the C1128 section count limit on
  MSVC.  `/bigobj` raises the limit so the unit compiles cleanly
  without splitting the file.

### Dependencies

- Bump `mozilla-actions/sccache-action` from 0.0.6 to 0.0.10 (#1941)
- Bump `actions/cache` from 4 to 5 (#1942)

## [v0.8.22] — 2026-04-25

### Connection visibility plus community polish

A connection-focused point release: new login/disconnect notifications
for remote clients, passive spots mode, find-search in help, plus a
stack of community-reported regression fixes (TCI WSJT-X TX, RADE
silent SSB, spectrum-click edge jumps, MultiFlex PTT).

### Features

**Band-stack auto-save on dwell**
- New "Auto-save dwell" setting in the band-stack ⚙ menu (Off / 10 s
  / 30 s / 60 s, default Off).  When enabled, the active slice is
  automatically added to the band stack after dwelling on a frequency
  for the configured time.  Skips entries within ±100 Hz of an
  existing bookmark (so you don't re-stack the same station), skips
  during transmit, and waits 5 s after connect before the first
  auto-save.  Caps auto-saved entries at **5 per ham band** —
  overflow drops the oldest auto-saved entry in that band, but
  manually-added bookmarks are never displaced.  Pairs naturally
  with the existing Auto-expiry option for a self-pruning rolling
  history.

**LAN and SmartLink client login notifications (#1892, jensenpat)**
- New connection-event notifications when remote LAN, SmartLink, and
  Maestro clients log in to the radio.  Surfaced as toast-style
  banners in the status bar so operators see Multi-Flex / shared-radio
  activity without watching the log.

**Remote client disconnect flows (#1889, jensenpat)**
- Disconnect remote LAN, SmartLink, and Maestro clients from inside
  AetherSDR.  Operator confirmation prompt + clean protocol teardown
  so the disconnected client sees a graceful exit rather than a stale
  session.

**Passive Spots mode (#1897, jensenpat)**
- New spots mode that ingests spot data without sending any commands
  to the radio — useful for read-only / observer scenarios where you
  want spot decorations on the spectrum but don't want the spot
  source to influence radio state.

**Device details in Slice Troubleshooter (#1898, jensenpat)**
- Slice Troubleshooter now reports audio and control device details
  alongside the existing slice diagnostics so support bundle reviewers
  can see the full I/O path from radio to host without a separate
  step.  Device-ID values are SHA-256 fingerprinted for privacy.

**Find search in help dialogs (#1899, jensenpat)**
- Help dialogs gain Ctrl+F find with case-insensitive search, F3 for
  Find Next, and Shift+F3 for Find Previous — the same shortcut
  behaviour users expect from any text viewer.

### Bug fixes

**Click-to-tune no longer recentres for clicks inside the visible spectrum (#1906, #1907)**
- Click-to-tune was triggering a comfort-margin pan recenter even
  when the click landed well inside the visible spectrum, making
  the outer 18% of each pan effectively a dead zone that auto-pulled
  the slice inward.  Two layers of fix: the spectrum-click path
  itself uses a 5% margin, *and* the `RevealOffscreen` intent that
  fires from the deferred active-slice change after a click now only
  reveals when the slice is truly outside the visible window (margin
  0).  Net behaviour matches SmartSDR — click anywhere visible and
  the panadapter stays put.

**TCI tx_enable echoes immediately to unblock WSJT-X v3.0.0 TX (#1689, #1691)**
- WSJT-X v3.0.0 waits for a `tx_enable` ack before keying.  AetherSDR's
  TCI handler now matches the `cmdTrx` pattern (immediate echo plus
  pending notification) so WSJT-X TX is unblocked on current builds.

**Fix silent audio in SSB/Digital modes when m_radeMode is active (#1875, #1879, NF0T)**
- RADE-mode activation toggled a DAX route flag in `AudioEngine` that
  left SSB and Digital modes silent on TX.  Audio path is now
  restored when RADE mode is not active.

**MultiFlex PTT label, row-selection, and correct PTT command (#1893, chibondking)**
- Three related Multi-Flex PTT issues: the PTT button label showed
  the wrong station (other client's name instead of ours), row
  selection had no effect, and the wrong protocol command was being
  sent.  `client set enforce_local_ptt=1` returns `0x50001000` on
  v1.4.0.0 — the correct command is `client set local_ptt=1`, which
  is now used and documented in `CLAUDE.md` quirks.

**Network health indicator stabilised for SmartLink and remote paths (#1900, jensenpat)**
- Status-bar network indicator was twitchy on LTE, SmartLink, and
  hotel Wi-Fi.  Now uses remote-friendly RTT thresholds, evaluates
  VITA packet loss over a rolling 10-second window, includes audio
  inter-arrival jitter, and adds display hysteresis so the label
  only changes state when the underlying condition is sustained.
  Tooltip and diagnostics dialog now also show recent packet loss
  and network jitter.

**Suppress startup client login replays (#1904, jensenpat)**
- When AetherSDR subscribed to `client all` after connecting, the
  radio replayed the current client list as `client ... connected`
  status messages — which the new notification handler from #1892
  treated as fresh logins.  Existing client handles captured from
  discovery and the SmartLink radio list are now treated as already
  present, with a 5-second startup grace window as a fallback.

**Persist CAT/TCI/DAX IQ enabled state across restarts (#1890, chibondking)**
- CAT, TCI, and DAX IQ enabled flags weren't written to AppSettings,
  so toggling any of them off and restarting brought them back on.
  Now persisted under their respective enabled keys and restored at
  startup.

**Reduce minimum window height (#1793, #1798)**
- Operators with smaller vertical footprints (low-resolution
  displays, cramped multi-monitor setups) couldn't shrink the main
  window below the prior height floor.  Lowered the minimum so
  small layouts fit.

**What's New release date now visible (#1783, #1785)**
- The release date line on the What's New dialog was being clipped
  off the visible area.  Layout now anchors the date inside the
  dialog frame.

**Restore Flex band-stack selection keys (#1887, jensenpat)**
- The hardware Flex front-panel band-stack keys had stopped routing
  to the band-stack selection action after a recent refactor.
  Re-wired so keypad band selection works again.

**Tighten incremental pan-follow margins**
- Trigger margin lowered from 12% → 5% and settle from 18% → 6% so
  trackpad / wheel / arrow-key tuning at the pan edge feels snappier
  without losing the smooth follow animation.

**Shorten client-connection status message from 10s to 3s**
- The transient banner shown after a successful connection was
  staying up too long and obscuring slice activity.

**Fix versioning label issue on Windows**
- Build version label on Windows could render incorrectly when the
  build metadata included certain characters.  Resolved.

**Band-stack ⚙ / × / + buttons no longer clip their glyphs**
- The three control buttons in the band-stack bottom row now have
  zero internal padding so the multiplication-sign, plus, and gear
  glyphs render fully inside the small fixed-size buttons regardless
  of font/DPI.

## [v0.8.21] — 2026-04-23

### Recenter policy unification plus Band Stack management

Another community-heavy point release.  Five community PRs plus six
AetherClaude fixes address crash + UX regressions uncovered in v0.8.20,
a Wayland+FFmpeg crash class, a RADE TX regression from v0.8.19, and
a large tuning-policy refactor that consolidates pan/zoom/reveal
decisions into one shared intent model.  Plus the first Band Stack
management feature (clear all, band grouping, auto-expiry).

### Features

**Unified tuning/recenter policy (#1861, jensenpat)**
- Large refactor (+1038/-207, new `RECENTER.md` design doc) that
  moves pan-follow, reveal, and hard-center decisions out of individual
  call sites and into a shared `MainWindow` policy layer.  Every tuning
  input path (VFO wheel, spectrum wheel, trackpad, keys, MIDI,
  FlexControl, HID, memory, spots, clicks, band stack) now dispatches
  through a small `TuneIntent` enum: `IncrementalTune`, `AbsoluteJump`,
  `CommandedTargetCenter`, `ExplicitPan`, `RevealOffscreen`.
- Incremental tuning now uses step-quantized follow (12 % trigger
  edge, 18 % settle, 110 ms animation) so trackpad / wheel / keys
  at the pan edge nudge smoothly instead of page-flipping.
- Combined pan/zoom operations now send one coherent
  `display pan set center=X bandwidth=Y` command instead of two
  separate commands — fixes the P1 waterfall-loss / edge-drop bug
  seen during bandwidth drag and trackpad zoom.
- Fixes the P2 keyboard zoom +/- drift seen after memory recall and
  mode jumps (USB ↔ SAM).
- Memory spot clicks no longer go through an intermediate generic
  spot path — memory recall owns the tune+center ordering end-to-end.
- See `RECENTER.md` for the full architecture, intent semantics,
  call-site classification, and intentional exception list (band
  shortcuts, `restoreBandState`, RxApplet direct entry, and CAT/TCI
  external-control paths still use `tuneAndRecenter`).

**Band Stack management (#1471 → #1472)**
- New UI affordances in the Band Stack sidebar:
  - **× button** — "Clear All" with a confirmation dialog, so
    accidental clears during contests don't wipe a day's work.
  - **⚙ button** — opens a settings menu for "Group by band" and
    auto-expiry (Off / 5 / 15 / 30 / 60 min).
- Grouped mode uses the existing band-definition table; each band
  section gets a header label and a right-click "Clear band" action.
- Auto-expiry defaults off.  Enabled expiry uses a 30-second timer
  that starts on radio connect and stops on disconnect, and
  stale-entry pruning also runs on startup so entries saved under
  an expiry threshold are cleaned when the app reopens.
- Backwards-compatible XML schema: pre-existing entries carry a
  `CreatedAtMs = 0` sentinel and are never auto-expired.
- Thanks to LU5DX for the feature request and LU5FF for the idea.

### Bug fixes

**Install tolerant X11 error handler (#1840)**
- Qt Multimedia's FFmpeg backend probes VA-API / VDPAU hardware
  accel via X11 even under native Wayland.  On systems that ship
  `libvdpau-va-gl` by default (openSUSE Tumbleweed + Packman is the
  canonical case, Fedora RPMfusion is adjacent), VDPAU calls into
  X11/GLX under Wayland → `BadAccess` → Xlib default handler calls
  `exit()` → AetherSDR crashes on Audio-tab open.
- Install a tolerant X11 error handler (via `dlopen(libX11.so.6)` +
  `XSetErrorHandler`) that logs the error and returns 0 instead of
  aborting.  Linux-only, no build-time X11 dependency.
- `AetherX11ErrorEvent` struct layout corrected to match XErrorEvent
  field order so the diagnostic log reports accurate error codes.

**DXCC prefix resolution off GUI thread (#1844)**
- 0.8.19 regression surfaced at 125 k-QSO log sizes: when the ADIF
  auto-reloader (new in 0.8.19) re-processed the logbook,
  `onParseFinished` did O(N) DXCC prefix lookups on the GUI thread,
  producing 0.5 – 1 s waterfall freezes.
- Move prefix resolution into the existing ADIF parse worker thread
  via an optional `AdifParser::setCtyParser()`.  `CtyDatParser` is
  demonstrably read-only after `loadCtyDat()`, so cross-thread access
  is safe.  GUI thread only does the cheap `m_workedStatus.load()`
  hash inserts on the queued callback.

**TCI RX meter post-gain (#1716 → #1717)**
- TCI RX level meter and DAX RX level meter in the same applet panel
  used different measurement points: TCI was pre-gain, DAX was
  post-gain.  At default gain 0.5 that made TCI read ~6 dB higher
  than DAX for the same signal.
- Maintainer decision (community RFC by NF0T): move TCI to post-gain
  to match DAX convention, SmartSDR convention, and make fader
  movement immediately visible on the meter.

**XVTR waterfall always black (#1845)**
- When a transverter is active the radio reports pan center in RF
  domain (e.g. 144.2 MHz) but the VITA-49 waterfall tile header
  carries IF-domain frequencies (e.g. ~28 MHz).  The existing
  frequency-accurate bin mapping then produced bin indices outside
  `srcSize` for every pixel and the scanline stayed all-black.
- Detect the tile/pan frequency mismatch in
  `MainWindow::waterfallRowReady` and shift the tile's reported
  low/high by `panCenter - tileCenter` so the existing
  frequency-accurate rendering in `SpectrumWidget` aligns with the
  pan.  HF panadapters are unaffected (their tiles always overlap,
  the shift branch never fires).

**PAN freeze in Minimal Mode with popped-out panadapter (#1748)**
- `toggleMinimalMode(true)` called `setUpdatesEnabled(false)` on
  every applet in `m_panStack->allApplets()`, which includes
  floating (popped-out) pans.  Their content froze even though
  their window was still visible.
- Skip floating pans on the suspend path via
  `PanadapterStack::isFloating()`.  CPU savings for normal
  (no-pop-out) minimal-mode use are preserved unchanged.

**rigctld TCP CAT per-port slice binding (#1621 → #1623)**
- WSJT-X sends `V VFOB` on init, which `cmdSetVfo()` was treating
  as an authoritative slice-index override.  Every WSJT-X instance
  across multiple rigctld ports then ended up controlling Slice B.
- `cmdSetVfo()` now accepts the command without changing
  `m_sliceIndex` (which is set per-connection by the TCP port
  binding in `RigctlServer::onNewConnection`).  `cmdGetVfo()`
  always reports VFOA (the current VFO for this connection) and
  `cmdGetSplitVfo()` decouples the client-visible VFO label from
  the internal slice id.
- Follow-up #1868 filed for the separate `cmdSetSplitVfo` stub on
  the enable=true path.

**RADE TX no-waveform regression from #1780 (#1865, NF0T)**
- v0.8.19 added `emit daxRouteRequested(on ? 0 : 1)` to
  `AudioEngine::setRadeMode` on the mistaken theory that RADE
  wanted the radio's mic path.  On PTT in RADE mode this sent
  `transmit set dax=0`, which made the radio discard every
  `dax_tx` VITA-49 packet from the RADE encoder and transmit
  silence from the physical mic.
- Remove the `daxRouteRequested` signal and its wiring entirely.
  `updateDaxTxMode` already sets `dax=1` when the TX slice is in
  DIGU/DIGL (which RADE activation configures), so the correct
  routing is always in place before PTT.

**Applet pop-out persistence and app-exit regression (#1860, chibondking)**
- Four bugs around the migration from the retired
  `FloatingAppletWindow` (System A) to the new `ContainerManager`
  (System B):
  1. `ContainerGeometry_P/CW` uses `/` which is invalid in
     AppSettings XML element names → silent save/load failure for
     the P/CW applet → position lost on every restart.  Fixed by
     sanitizing `/` → `_` in `geometryKeyFor`, matching System A's
     `floatKey()` helper.
  2. Legacy float-state migration read the raw ID while System A
     wrote the sanitized key → P/CW users migrating from older
     versions saw the applet docked.  Same sanitizer applied to
     the read path.
  3. Floating windows kept the process alive after the main window
     closed, because they inherited `WA_QuitOnClose=true` as
     top-level widgets.  `WA_QuitOnClose=false` now marks them as
     secondary.
  4. `moveEvent`/`resizeEvent` wrote AppSettings on every pixel of
     a window drag (~60 Hz).  Replaced with a 400 ms debounce
     timer matching System A's original pattern.

**Arduino WiFiServer TCP deadlock for ShackSwitch R4 (#1859, nigelfenton)**
- ShackSwitch R4 is an Arduino-based Antenna Genius.  Arduino's
  `WiFiServer::available()` only returns a connected client once
  the client has sent data, but the AG protocol is
  server-speaks-first (`V1.0 AG`).  Result: AetherSDR waits for the
  greeting, R4 waits for client data → TCP deadlock → every AG
  connect silently hangs.
- Detect ShackSwitch devices (`name.contains("ShackSwitch")`) and send
  an empty `\r\n` on TCP connect.  R4 firmware discards empty lines
  before the greeting, protocol proceeds normally.  Real 4O3A Antenna
  Genius devices do not match the check — zero impact on existing AG
  behaviour.
- Also fix a reconnect-race by replacing the `if (m_connected)` guard
  with an unconditional socket abort in `connectToDevice`, plus
  add an `isConnecting()` helper for UI state.
- Contributed by Nigel Fenton (G0JKN) — the author of the ShackSwitch
  device itself.

## [v0.8.20] — 2026-04-22

### Community regression round-up + crash batch

Eight community contributions plus three AetherClaude crash fixes.
The community batch covers real-world regressions found on Windows,
macOS and Linux: RADE RX on Windows, macOS FT8 DT bias, TCI DAX
crosstalk, RX applet pan-with-NR, gain defaults, a Windows build
break, a Canadian band plan refresh, and seamless ADIF logbook
auto-reload.  Three crash fixes address applet reorder, Wayland
Radio Setup dialog, and popped-out panadapter freeze.

### Bug fixes

**Fix RADE RX not decoding on Windows (#1820, NF0T)**
- On platforms without a DAX audio bridge (Windows, Linux without
  PipeWire), `startDax()` is compiled out so `stream create dax_rx`
  is never sent.  RADE mode showed "activated" but produced no
  decoded audio because `feedRxAudio()` never got called.
- `activateRADE()` now creates the `dax_rx` stream directly on
  non-bridge platforms and registers its stream ID with
  PanadapterStream.  TCI borrow-safe cleanup on deactivate — won't
  tear down a stream another client is reading.
- Verified end-to-end on Windows 11 + FLEX-8400.

**Clamp stale DAX RX backlog on macOS (#1822, jensenpat)**
- FT8 decodes in WSJT-X / JTDX showed a consistent +1.5 s to +1.6 s
  `DT` offset on macOS even with healthy LAN latency — severe enough
  to cause missed QSOs.
- Root cause: macOS `VirtualAudioBridge` writes DAX RX audio into a
  POSIX shared-memory ring large enough for ~2 s of audio.  The TX
  path had live-edge backlog protection; the RX path did not.  If
  the CoreAudio reader fell behind the ring accumulated stale audio
  and served it as if current.
- New live-edge clamp advances the reader when backlog exceeds
  ~200 ms, keeping a ~40 ms target.  Per-channel timing counters
  behind the existing `aether.dax` debug category.  Scoped to macOS
  only — Linux uses `O_NONBLOCK` named pipes (drops at syscall),
  Windows has no in-process buffer.

**Fix TCI DAX audio crosstalk between slices (#1815, Chaosuk97)**
- Two simultaneous DAX channels (dual-band WSJT-X, satellite
  full-duplex RX) caused audio from slice A to bleed into slice B.
- Root cause: `r8brain CDSPResampler` is stateful.  `ClientState`
  held a single shared resampler reused across channels, so filter
  state from channel 1 carried over into channel 2.  The
  accumulation buffer was already per-channel; the resampler wasn't.
- Replaced the shared `Resampler*` with
  `QHash<int, Resampler*> resamplers` keyed by DAX channel.  Lazy
  per-channel creation, `qDeleteAll()` on rate change / disconnect.

**Fix RX applet pan slider broken with NR active (#1799, Chaosuk97)**
- PR #1460 re-applied pan after client NR mono-mix but only tracked
  pan changes from the VFO panel slider.  The RX applet, MIDI, and
  keyboard shortcuts call `SliceModel::setAudioPan()` directly —
  `AudioEngine::m_rxPan` stayed at 50, making the RX applet pan
  slider a no-op when NR was active.
- Listen to `SliceModel::audioPanChanged` instead — one connection
  now covers VFO panel, RX applet, MIDI, and radio echo-back on
  connect.

**Fix TCI RX gain default fallback: 1.0 → 0.5 (#1811, NF0T)**
- `TciServer` fallback for a missing `TciRxGain<n>` key was "1.0"
  while `TciApplet` used "0.5".  Fresh install or post-migration
  without the key ran the server at full gain while the slider
  showed half — TCI RX audio 2× louder than DAX at equal positions.

**Fix missing HAVE_SERIALPORT guard on m_flexCoalesceTimer (#1812, NF0T)**
- PR #1606 guarded `m_hidCoalesceTimer` behind `HAVE_HIDAPI` but
  left `m_flexCoalesceTimer` unguarded on the line above — broke
  Windows builds without `Qt6::SerialPort`.  Wrapped the reference
  in `HAVE_SERIALPORT` to match the member declaration.

**Seamless ADIF logbook auto-reload for DXCC spot colouring (#1801, Chaosuk97)**
- Spot colours only updated when the user manually clicked Browse
  and re-selected the log file.  The "Auto-Reload Log" toggle
  defaulted off and broke in edge cases: atomic rename (N1MM,
  Log4OM), Windows write-lock during export, delete-then-recreate.
- Toggle removed — Browse now always arms the watcher.  2-second
  debounce coalesces rapid change notifications; watcher re-arms
  after debounce so atomic rename (new inode) is caught.  Directory
  watcher on the parent folder catches delete-then-recreate.  Open
  retries 3× at 500 ms intervals for write-locks.  Worked status
  preserved on open failure — colours don't flash empty during
  export.  "Updating…" shown during async parse.

**Fix crash when reordering applets with floating containers (#1745 → #1746)**
- Dragging an applet title bar to reorder crashed AetherSDR when
  any other applet was popped out into a floating window.
- Root cause: `QWidget::mapTo()` traverses the parent chain looking
  for a common ancestor.  When a container is floating (reparented
  to `FloatingContainerWindow` — a separate top-level window), there
  is no common ancestor with the scroll area's content widget and
  `mapTo()` dereferences `nullptr`.
- `dragMoveEvent()`, `dropIndexFromY()` and `rebuildStackOrder()`
  now skip entries whose `ContainerWidget::isFloating()` is true.
  Follow-up filed as #1836 for the separate TXDSP ID-mismatch that
  makes that container silently un-reorderable.

**Lazy-build RadioSetupDialog tabs (#1776 → #1777)**
- Opening Settings → Radio Setup / FlexControl / USB Cables crashed
  on some Wayland / Qt 6.11 configurations (openSUSE Tumbleweed with
  Packman non-free FFmpeg 8.1).  Real crash cause is
  `libvdpau_va_gl` trying to create a VDPAU device via X11/GLX on a
  native Wayland session — an upstream Qt Multimedia backend /
  distro packaging problem, not an AetherSDR bug.
- Converted the dialog from eager to lazy tab construction — only
  the Radio tab builds on open; the other ten tabs get placeholder
  widgets and deferred builders triggered on first tab-switch.
  Dialog opens without crashing (and faster on every platform).
  Users on the affected config will still hit the VDPAU crash if
  they click the Audio tab; the real fix is to switch
  `QT_MEDIA_BACKEND=gstreamer` or use stock Mesa FFmpeg.

**Fix UI freeze when PanAdapter is popped out (#1668 → #1669)**
- Content inside a popped-out panadapter froze — waterfall stopped
  scrolling, spectrum stopped updating — while the main window
  remained fully responsive.  Re-docking restored normal operation.
- Two problems in `PanadapterStack::floatPanadapter()`: the
  SpectrumWidget was shown immediately after reparenting, before
  `refreshAfterReparent()` rebound the Metal render target to the
  new NSView, so the first frame rendered on a stale/transitional
  surface.  And the reparent went through `setParent(nullptr)` —
  on macOS with `WA_NativeWindow`, that creates a transient
  top-level NSWindow before the floating window adopts it, a second
  lesser problem addressed by #1344 for the dock path but never the
  float path.
- New `PanFloatingWindow::adoptApplet()` method reparents directly
  via `m_layout->addWidget()` — single splitter→floating-window
  step, no nullptr intermediate.  `sw->show()` moved into the
  deferred callback after `refreshAfterReparent()` so Metal binds
  to the final NSView before the first render.

**Minor Canadian band-plan corrections (#1817, VE3NEM)**
- RAC band plan updates from a Canadian ham: label corrections on
  overlapping CW/DIG segments (1.800, 7.035), WSPR 80 m frequency
  corrected (3.5926 → 3.5686 MHz), obsolete CW calling frequencies
  removed and standard international QRP calling frequencies added
  (14.060, 21.060, 28.060, etc.), missing SSB calling frequencies
  added on 17 m / 15 m / 12 m / 10 m / 1.25 m.

AetherClaude bug fixes on #1745 / #1776 / #1668.

## [v0.8.19] — 2026-04-20

### Community contributions landfest + macOS MNR + quick memory actions

This release is mostly community work.  Ten community PRs landed, plus an
AetherClaude-draft fix batch covering bandwidth-correction echoes, stale
slice-click tuning, Windows rigctld IPv4, serial port persistence, DX
cluster reconnect, compression-meter gain reduction, and macOS audio
device override.

### Features

**macOS MMSE-Wiener spectral noise reduction (MNR) (#1672, Chaosuk97)**
- New macOS-exclusive client-side NR mode accelerated via Apple
  Accelerate (vDSP / AMX on Apple Silicon).  Decision-directed
  MMSE-Wiener filter with 25-frame minimum-statistics noise-floor
  tracking.  512-point real FFT at 24 kHz, 50% overlap-add with
  sqrt-Hann window, per-bin gain with temporal smoothing to suppress
  musical noise.  ~0.3 ms per hop on M-series chips, one-hop startup
  latency (≈10.7 ms).
- MNR button appears in both the VFO DSP tab and the spectrum overlay
  DSP panel.  DSP Settings dialog gains a new MNR tab with a strength
  slider (0-100).  Mutually exclusive with NR2/RN2/NR4/BNR/DFNR.
  Persists enable state + strength across restart.
- Non-Apple builds: `#ifdef __APPLE__` gated throughout — zero MNR
  overhead, buttons hidden.

**PooDoo™ TX Reverb (#1741) — carried forward, chain now complete**
- Already shipped in v0.8.18 final release notes; listed here for
  completeness since it rolls into the 0.8.19 post-release chain view.

**Quick memory browse + save on slice overlays (#1781, jensenpat)**
- Two new actions in the slice overlay rail between Display and DAX:
  - **MEM▸** opens a compact 252×430 browser drawer, frequency-sorted,
    pre-scrolled to the active slice's nearest memory.  Click-to-recall.
  - **MEM+** opens a small save dialog for the current slice on that
    panadapter.  Captures mode, filter, step, repeater offset, tone,
    squelch, RTTY/DIGL offsets — same field set as the main Memory
    dialog via the new shared `MemoryCommands` helper module.
- Pan-aware routing: save/recall targets the active slice if it lives
  on this pan, otherwise the first slice found on the pan.  The MEM
  buttons now show the target slice letter (e.g. `MEM▸ A`) so users
  can see which slice will be hit before clicking — makes the
  multi-slice fallback visible.

**Improved TNF notch interaction (#1547, rfoust)**
- TNF markers no longer extend into the waterfall — they stop at the
  bottom of the spectrum pane so the waterfall stays a historical
  signal record.
- Depth visualisation via hatching (12/8/5 px spacing for depth 1/2/3).
- Floating "RF Tracking Notch" popup on hover shows frequency + width.
- Width/depth submenu items show a checkmark on the currently-active
  value.
- Bidirectional TNF drag: horizontal tunes, vertical resizes via
  `2^(-dy/48)` octaves, clamped 10-12 000 Hz.
- Preferred-TNF hit-testing for overlapping notches — dragging a TNF
  preserves the target across its sibling's overlap zone.
- Tune guides suppressed while a TNF is hovered or dragged.
- `TnfModel`: optimistic local updates in setters so UI responds
  without waiting for radio echo; width parser tolerates both Hz
  ("width=100") and fractional-MHz forms for firmware-version variance.

**RAC Canada Band Plan corrected + expanded (#1709, VE3NEM)**
- VHF / UHF bands added (6 m, 2 m, 1.25 m, 70 cm) — prior file was
  HF-only, so 4 new ham-band coverage tiers arrive in this update.
- 60 m channels updated to match the Feb 2026 ISED regulation change
  (new 5.3570-5.3598 channel).
- 12 m frequencies corrected.
- FT8 spot at 14.074 added back, one duplicate spot removed.

**Frameless Window toggle (View menu, Ctrl+Shift+F)**
- View → Frameless Window applies Qt's `FramelessWindowHint` so users
  gain ~32 px of vertical screen space at the cost of the OS title bar.
  Works cross-platform (X11, Wayland, Windows, macOS) — KDE window
  rules don't strip Qt's client-side decorations reliably on Wayland,
  so we drop the frame in code.  Move/close via WM shortcuts or
  taskbar.  Persists across restart; applied before first `show()` so
  there's no flash-of-chrome on startup.

**CHAIN-driven TX DSP (v0.8.18 rebase — carried forward)**
- Already in v0.8.18 release notes; called out here because subsequent
  releases continue to build on the CHAIN ordering.

### Bug fixes

**NR2 crackling on strong signals (#1696, Chaosuk97)**
- Cap `gainMax` default 1.5 → 1.0.  The MMSE-LSA estimator is a noise
  *reducer* — the old 1.5 default allowed 50% amplification on strong
  signals, which pushed output past ±1.0 float32 full scale and caused
  QAudioSink digital-clipping crackle.
- Belt-and-suspenders `std::clamp(sample, -1.0f, 1.0f)` in
  `processNr2()`.  A separate Bessel overflow (issue #1507) can still
  produce NaN-burst crackle on Gamma-method NR2 under strong-signal
  conditions — tracked for follow-up, not in this release.

**Audio pan broken with client NR active (#1685, Chaosuk97) + per-slice AF mute persistence (#1560)**
- Client-side NR (NR2 / RN2 / NR4 / DFNR) mono-mixes L+R before
  processing, destroying the radio-applied pan.  New
  `AudioEngine::setRxPan` atomic + static `applyRxPanInPlace` helper
  re-applies a linear pan law to the NR output so the pan slider
  continues to work while client NR is active.  No-op at pan 50
  (centre) — zero overhead when user hasn't panned.
- Per-slice AF mute now persists across sessions.  VFO widget emits
  `audioMuteToggled`; MainWindow saves `SliceAudioMuted_{A,B,C,D}` to
  AppSettings on every user toggle, restores on reconnect.  Uses the
  slice letter (not numeric id) for the settings key so state survives
  sessions where the radio assigns a different numeric id.

**VFO / TNF / filter-edge ±1 px jitter during tuning (#1703, Chaosuk97) + cursor-snap-to-VFO (#1369)**
- `mhzToX()` switched from integer truncation to `std::round` so the
  same frequency always maps to the same pixel column regardless of
  pan-center fractional drift during continuous tune.  One-line fix
  that ripples through every vertical marker — VFO, TNF, filter edges,
  RIT/XIT, band plan, spots, grid.
- Cursor frequency readout snaps to the exact VFO frequency when
  within 8 px of a slice marker (GPU path already had this; software
  `paintEvent` path added for symmetry).
- `setSliceOverlayFreq()` now calls `markOverlayDirty()` and
  early-exits on unchanged value.

**Zoom +/- can't reach full panadapter bandwidth (#1697, Chaosuk97)**
- Replace early-return guard in `emitZoom` / keyboard zoom with
  `std::clamp(newBw, minBwMhz, maxBwMhz)` so the final click/keypress
  snaps to exactly the radio's min/max — matching the mouse-drag
  behaviour which already used clamp.

**PC Audio button shows wrong state on connect (#1695, Chaosuk97)**
- `onConnectionStateChanged` now reads `PcAudioEnabled` once and calls
  both `m_titleBar->setPcAudioEnabled(...)` (sync button, with
  QSignalBlocker) and `audioStartRx()` from the same decision.
  Previously the sink and button could diverge after a profile import.

**Waterfall filter-passband fill removed (#1701, Chaosuk97)**
- The coloured filter-passband fill in the waterfall was only rendered
  by the software-fallback paintEvent path — the GPU renderer already
  skipped it.  Dropping the software `fillRect` brings the two render
  paths into agreement.  Filter edge lines still render in both panes.

**TCI DAX duplicate stream causing 2× audio speed (#1679 / #1678)**
- Two code paths both subscribing to `dax_rx` for the same channel
  made `daxAudioReady` fire twice per period, doubling WSJT-X's
  apparent sample rate and killing FT8 decode.  Registration now
  evicts stale subscribers and TCI uses a borrow protocol.

**TCI TX no RF output (#1680)**
- Always emit `transmit set dax=1` on PTT regardless of the previous
  Low-Latency DAX menu toggle.  The `dax=0` path was advertised for
  external FreeDV over virtual audio cable but never actually worked
  because that route silently drops `dax_tx` VITA-49 packets.  The
  Low-Latency DAX menu has since been retired (#1780).

**Low-Latency DAX consolidated into RADE mode (#1780)**
- The "Low-Latency DAX (FreeDV)" menu item was removed.  RADE mode's
  activation now emits a `daxRouteRequested` signal that MainWindow
  routes to `transmit set dax=N`, flipping the route atomically with
  the RADE button.  One control, one place.  Stale
  `DaxTxLowLatency` AppSettings value is no longer read.

**Bandwidth corrections silently dropped during pan-follow (#1729)**
- The stale-echo guard in `setFrequencyRange` bypassed *any* echo
  during an in-flight pan-center animation when the center matched.
  If the echo also carried a bandwidth correction (e.g. post-resize
  `xpixels` re-sync), it was thrown away.  Guard now also checks the
  bandwidth field so legitimate corrections pass through.

**Pan-follow VFO edge-tracking after manual drag (#1643)**
- After a manual spectrum drag, `PanadapterModel::centerMhz` lagged
  the visible pan center by up to one frame.  `panFollowVfo` now
  reads the live center from the spectrum widget instead of the
  model, so edge-fence checks fire against the user's actual view.

**Propagation overlay click tunes VFO by accident (#1647)**
- Clicking the K/SFI propagation overlay was also triggering the
  release-to-tune path.  Set `m_spotClickConsumed = true` after the
  `propForecastClicked` emission so the subsequent release event
  can short-circuit.

**Off-screen slice click tunes wrong frequency (#1772)**
- Same pattern as the prop-overlay fix: clicking an off-screen slice
  indicator now suppresses release-to-tune so the tuning action
  doesn't pile on top of the slice-activate.

**rigctld TCP server not accepting IPv4 on Windows (#1737)**
- `QHostAddress::Any` sometimes binds IPv6-only on Windows, leaving
  IPv4 clients unable to connect.  Use `QHostAddress::AnyIPv4`
  explicitly.

**Serial port parameters (data bits, parity, stop bits) not persisted (#1610)**
- RadioSetupDialog's serial tab built the combos with defaults but
  never read from AppSettings or connected the save handler.  Added
  both.

**Compression meter shows raw dBFS instead of gain reduction (#1682)**
- COMPPEAK is the compressor *output* level; AFTEREQ is the *input*.
  Meter was displaying raw COMPPEAK, which just shows "how loud is
  the output" instead of "how much is the compressor reducing".  Now
  shows `output - input` (gain reduction, 0 = no reduction, negative
  = compressing).

**macOS audio output device silently overridden (#1705)**
- On macOS, AudioEngine replaced the user's chosen output device with
  `QMediaDevices::defaultAudioOutput()` whenever Qt reported 48 kHz
  as unsupported — but that happens on some normal CoreAudio outputs
  with newer Qt, not just Bluetooth telephony routes.  Narrow the
  override to devices that genuinely can't handle the native 24 kHz
  format.

### Internal

**Issue template tightened**
- Bug-report reproduction steps are now required.  AetherSDR version,
  radio model+firmware, and OS are required fields with platform-
  specific guidance (Linux distro + Qt / macOS version + chip /
  Windows edition).  Improves triage quality on incoming reports.

**Contributors**
- Added VE3NEM, Ian M7HNF (Chaosuk97), and jensenpat to the About
  dialog contributors list.

### Reverted

- The spectrum/waterfall alignment tweak from #1694 was landed as a
  partial fix (alignment math only, skipping an unrelated
  SMOOTH_ALPHA tuning change) then reverted when the trimmed fix
  introduced misalignment rather than correcting it.  Issue #1690
  closed — the originally-reported bug did not reproduce on main.

## [v0.8.18] — 2026-04-20

### PooDoo™ TX Audio — complete six-stage DSP chain, click-bypass, reverb

### Features

**PooDoo™ Audio: Gate, DeEss, Tube, PUDU DSPs + editors (#1661 phases 2-5, #1734)**
- Four new client-side TX DSP stages complete the chain started in v0.8.17:
  - **ClientGate** — downward expander / noise gate with Expander↔Gate
    mode toggle, threshold/ratio/attack/hold/release/floor/return/look-ahead
    parameters, Ableton-style level view with two-threshold hysteresis band.
  - **ClientDeEss** — sidechain-filtered de-esser.  Tunable bandpass
    (1-12 kHz log sweep, Q 0.5-5) feeds the envelope detector; threshold +
    amount parameters control broadband attenuation on sibilance.
  - **ClientTube** — dynamic tube saturator with three models (A: soft
    tanh, B: hard-clip + tanh hybrid, C: asymmetric) + bipolar envelope-
    driven drive, tilt pre-filter, parallel dry/wet mix.
  - **ClientPudu** — exciter modelled on Aphex Aural Exciter + Big Bottom
    (Even mode — asymmetric harmonics + LF saturation) and Behringer
    SX 3040 (Odd mode — symmetric tanh + feed-forward LF compressor).
    Six-knob Poo/Doo layout with glowing PooDoo™ wordmark driven by wet
    RMS level.
- Every stage has a full-featured floating editor with Ableton-style
  visualisations: level histograms, curve overlays, live envelope
  balls.  Editors run lock-free atomic parameter updates with a version
  counter so audio-thread `process()` never locks or allocates.
- Consistent visual language across all editors: uniform 76×76 knobs
  with in-ring labels that auto-shrink to fit, right-aligned Bypass
  buttons, and uniform "Thresh" / "Freq" naming conventions.
- Per-stage test harnesses in `tests/client_*_test.cpp` covering DSP
  invariants (impulse response, ratio curves, mix laws, stereo
  linkage, finite output under extreme params).

**PUDU Monitor — post-chain record + playback (#1734)**
- Two icon buttons in the CHAIN header (⏺ record, ▶ play) capture up to
  30 seconds of **post-PUDU TX audio** without transmitting.  Recording
  writes an int16 stereo 24 kHz WAV to `/tmp/pudu_monitor.wav` for
  offline inspection; playback streams from an in-memory buffer through
  the existing RX sink path.
- Record button is only enabled when MIC=PC and DAX=off — same
  condition that turns the `[MIC]` endpoint green in the CHAIN widget.
  Transitioning out of that state mid-record auto-stops.
- During recording and playback the RX panadapter stream is
  disconnected from the audio sink (same pattern as QsoRecorder) so
  live band audio doesn't bleed under the preview.

**Reverb (Freeverb) stage + CHAIN integration (#1741)**
- New **ClientReverb** DSP — Jezar's canonical Freeverb algorithm: 8
  parallel lowpass-feedback comb filters summed through 4 series
  allpass filters, stereo-spread by 23 samples between channels.
  Pre-delay ring buffer in front of the reverb core.  Sample-rate-
  scaled for 24 kHz native processing; CPU cost under 1 % of one core.
- Five-knob control set: **Size** (0-100 %), **Decay** (0.3-5 s
  exponential), **Damping** (0-100 %), **Pre-delay** (0-100 ms),
  **Mix** (0-100 %).
- Ships **disabled by default** and positioned as the final stage
  (`[MIC]→[GATE]→[EQ]→[DESS]→[COMP]→[TUBE]→[PUDU]→[VERB]→[TX]`) — reverb
  on ham TX is unusual and trades intelligibility for "bigness".  Users
  opt in by single-clicking `[VERB]` in CHAIN.
- Settings persisted as `ClientReverbTx*` in `AppSettings`.  9-case
  test harness covers impulse tail, decay monotonicity, dry/wet laws,
  pre-delay timing, mono/stereo processing.

**CHAIN gesture set — single-click bypass, double-click edit (#1739)**
- CHAIN widget rewires the click gestures:
  - **Single-click** a stage → toggle bypass.
  - **Double-click** a stage → open its floating editor.
  - **Drag** a stage → reorder the chain.
  - **Right-click** → context menu (Edit… / Bypass).
- Deferred single-click timer (at the OS double-click interval) lets a
  genuine double-click cancel the pending bypass toggle so the gestures
  don't fight.
- **Bypass buttons removed from every node editor** — bypass now lives
  exclusively on the CHAIN widget.  Enable / Edit buttons removed from
  every applet tile (GATE, CEQ, DESS, CMP, TUBE, PUDU) since the CHAIN
  is now the single source of truth.

**Applet-tile knob rows (#1739)**
- Every DSP node's applet tile grows a compact 4-5 knob tuning row at
  PUDU-style 38×48 px so common parameters can be tweaked without
  opening the full editor:
  - **GATE**: Thresh · Ratio · Attack · Release · Floor
  - **DESS**: Freq · Q · Thresh · Amount
  - **CMP**: Thresh · Ratio · Attack · Release · Makeup
  - **TUBE**: Drive · Tone · Bias · Output · Mix
  - **PUDU**: Drive · Tune · Mix | Tune · Air · Mix (Poo/Doo groups)
  - **VERB**: Size · Decay · Damp · Pre · Mix
- 30 Hz two-way sync (QSignalBlocker-guarded) keeps applet and editor
  knobs in lock-step when values change in either surface.

**Applet-stack order mirrors CHAIN order (#1739)**
- Dragging a stage to a new position in CHAIN automatically reorders
  the sub-container tiles inside the PooDoo™ Audio group to match.
  On startup the persisted chain order drives the initial tile order.
- CEQ titlebar shows "COMPRESSOR" (was "CMP"); TXDSP group button bar
  label renamed "VUDU" → "PUDU" to match the exciter node; Settings
  key stays `Applet_TXDSP` for migration.

**Visual TX signal chain applet (#1661)**
- New CHAIN tile renders the full TX DSP path as a row of labelled
  boxes — MIC → GATE → EQ → DESS → COMP → TUBE → ENH → TX — with
  live bypass state, drag-drop reordering, per-stage click-to-edit
  and right-click bypass.  Snake layout wraps to 3-3-2 rows so the
  full chain fits inside the 260 px applet panel without cramping
  box labels.
- DSP: generalised TX chain replaces the previous two-option
  CMP↔EQ toggle with a generic ordered stage list stored as a
  packed uint64_t atomic (one byte per slot).  Audio thread loads
  the whole chain in one acquire-read per block; `applyClientTxDsp`
  walks the stage list and dispatches to the matching per-stage
  apply helper.  Gate, DeEss, Tube, Enh are stub slots today —
  placeholders for Phase 2+ Pro-XL work — and users can drag them
  into their preferred position now so the layout is ready when
  their DSP ships.
- Existing ClientCompTxChainOrder (0/1) settings migrate cleanly:
  legacy CMP-first / EQ-first positions carry over into the new
  stage list with the canonical stages (Gate, DeEss, Tube, Enh)
  appended in sensible slots.

**Unified TX DSP container**
- CHAIN, CEQ and CMP are now three sections of a single TXDSP tile
  in the applet tray.  Each section has its own titlebar with its
  own float / close buttons so individual sections can pop out
  independently, while the outer tray toggle, drag-handle and
  settings all treat the group as one coherent unit.
- CEQ and CMP tile visibility is driven by DSP bypass state — right-
  clicking a stage in the CHAIN widget or toggling the Bypass button
  inside an editor hides the corresponding section; enabling it
  brings the section back.  No separate "show tile" toggle.

**Applet panel pop-out**
- View → "Pop Out Applet Panel" (Ctrl+Shift+S) floats the entire
  right-side panel into its own top-level window.  Splitter slot
  collapses to zero; spectrum takes the reclaimed width.  Close
  the floating window (or toggle the menu item) to dock back at
  the remembered width.  Position and size persist across launches.

**Post-fader level meters on DAX / TCI**
- MeterSlider now multiplies its displayed RMS by the gain thumb
  before rendering, so moving the fader on a TCI or DAX channel
  gives immediate visual feedback instead of showing the raw
  pre-fader level.

**Consistent meter motion — MeterSmoother**
- Extracted the asymmetric attack/release smoothing pattern used
  by HGauge into a shared MeterSmoother helper (30 ms attack,
  180 ms release, polled at 120 Hz).  Applied to HGauge,
  ClientCompMeter, ClientCompApplet's GR strip and MeterSlider so
  every metering surface in the app reads with identical ballistics.

### Fixes

**Digital-mode TX routing**
- AudioEngine bypasses client-side Comp + EQ on the DAX/TCI TX path
  so WSJT-X and fldigi tones reach the radio unshaped.  Mic voice
  TX continues to run through the full client-side DSP chain.
- Fixed limiter envelope that could latch "active" forever after
  any trigger because the envelope decays asymptotically toward
  1.0 in float and never reaches it — now uses a 0.005 dB threshold
  to detect "not firing" which releases the active indicator.

**Compressor editor polish**
- Threshold fader on the left of the compressor editor replaces
  the old numeric label + tiny triangle with a combined input-
  level meter + draggable slider, matching the Client EQ output
  fader visual language.
- Threshold chevron on the curve gained a full-height dashed guide
  line so it reads from across the room; hit-test widened to grab
  anywhere along the vertical column.
- Live tooltips on the threshold chevron and ratio handle show the
  current value and describe the gesture.
- Limiter visualization: bright amber ceiling line on the Output
  meter, dim red "no-go zone" above, cyan GR tick showing how much
  the limiter is reducing, and a three-state LIMIT button
  (disarmed / armed / firing) that glows red for 500 ms after each
  clamp event.

### Under the hood

**Container system (#1713, foundation library)**
- New src/gui/containers/ subsystem: ContainerWidget (generic
  dockable wrapper), ContainerTitleBar (header with float/close/
  drag handle), FloatingContainerWindow (top-level host with
  geometry persistence + screen-visibility safety),
  ContainerManager (lifecycle + path lookup + content factory +
  JSON persistence under the ContainerTree settings key).
- Supports arbitrary nesting — a container's body can hold leaf
  widgets, other containers, or any mix.  Each container has its
  own float/dock/visibility state; transitions cascade correctly
  across parent/child relationships (floated parent takes docked
  children with it, floated child is independent of its parent's
  state, etc.).
- 80-assertion test suite across three harnesses covering
  lifecycle, manager persistence round-trip, and all eight of the
  nested-float/dock/hide edge cases called out in the design plan.
- This release uses the container system for just the TXDSP group.
  Future features needing grouped dockable tiles (RX DSP cluster,
  meter groups, macro panels) build on the same foundation without
  re-litigating the architecture.

**ClientCompKnob refinements**
- Shared rotary knob widget gains a **center-label mode** (draws the
  parameter name inside the ring instead of above) used by every new
  editor so the 270° arc, the label, and the value readout live in a
  tight 76×76 footprint.  Label font auto-shrinks to `diameter / 6`
  so "Thresh" / "Release" render at the same size as "Hold" across a
  knob row.
- Value readout now sits in the empty 90° sector at the bottom of the
  arc instead of below the widget — no gap between ring and value.

### Fixes

**CEQ cascade Q honouring (#1739)**
- Fix regression where HP/LP bands ignored the user-set Q on cascade
  slopes.  Cascade-slope refactor had hardcoded the family Q; new
  `resonanceScale = userQ / 0.707` multiplier restores user control
  of resonance for slopes above 12 dB/oct.

**PUDU monitor audio routing (#1734)**
- Earlier implementation mixed recorded int16 directly into the sink
  (wrong format, blew out speakers) and interleaved playback with
  live RX audio.  Fixed: convert int16→float32 before enqueueing at
  10 ms cadence; mute RX by disconnecting the pan stream ↔ AudioEngine
  signal rather than calling `setMuted()` (which silenced our own
  playback too).

## [v0.8.17] — 2026-04-19

### Client-side TX Compressor (Pro-XL-style, Phase 1) + Fully-interactive 10-band Client EQ

### Features

**Client EQ — 10-band parametric, 4 filter families, output fader (#1650 / #1651 / #1658 / #1660)**
- Client-side 10-band parametric EQ on both RX (post-NR, pre-sink) and
  TX (post-mic, pre-VITA-49) paths.  Default layout: HP / Low Shelf /
  6× Peak / High Shelf / LP, all disabled on first launch
- Each pass (HP / LP) band cascades up to 4 biquad sections for slopes
  of 12 / 24 / 36 / 48 dB/oct; peak / shelf bands stay native 2nd-order
- Global filter-family enum: Butterworth (flat maximal), Chebyshev I
  (1 dB ripple), Bessel (tabulated pole Q/mag for orders 2-8), Elliptic
  (Chebyshev-II-ish approximation).  Display path sums section
  magnitudes in dB from the analog prototype, in double precision, so
  the curve stays clean at all frequencies
- Grabbing a handle or clicking an icon auto-enables the band.  Right-
  click handles for type picker, bypass, reset-to-default; HP / LP also
  get a Slope submenu
- Live post-EQ FFT analyzer overlaid on the response curve (2048-point
  Cooley-Tukey at ~25 Hz, fed from an audio-thread ring buffer with no
  UI-side mutex).  Gradient terminates at the last valid bin so there's
  no misleading plateau above Nyquist
- Combined output-fader widget on the right edge: one custom-painted
  widget with a vertical peak meter, dB scale (0 / -6 / -12 / -20 / -40)
  and a horizontal fader handle that overhangs the bar on both sides.
  Click-drag, wheel for 0.5 dB fine step, double-click resets to 0 dB
- Settings migrate cleanly — existing users' saved bands map into the
  new 10-slot layout

**Client-side TX compressor (Pro-XL-style, Phase 1) (#1661)**
- Feed-forward compressor with soft-knee quadratic interpolation, linear-
  domain peak envelope detection, stereo-linked gain application, and a
  brickwall peak limiter on the output
- Parameters: threshold (-60..0 dB), ratio (1:1..20:1), attack (0.1..300 ms),
  release (5..2000 ms), knee (0..24 dB), makeup (-12..+24 dB), limiter
  enable + ceiling (-24..0 dB)
- Chain-order toggle in the editor: CMP→EQ (default, colour-then-shape)
  or EQ→CMP (shape-then-tame) — the two client-side TX DSP stages now
  run in a user-configurable order
- Atomic parameter handoff from UI to audio thread, lock-free, no alloc
  in process(), identical pattern to ClientEq

**Docked Compressor applet + floating editor**
- View-only CMP tile in the applet tray: live transfer curve with a
  glowing ball that slides along the curve at the current envelope level,
  horizontal GR strip beneath, Bypass toggle + Edit… button
- Full floating editor (Ableton-inspired, extended for our limiter and
  chain order): rotary knobs for Ratio / Attack / Release / Knee /
  Makeup / Ceiling, interactive transfer curve with draggable threshold
  handle + ratio handle, vertical Input / GR / Output meters, Limiter
  enable toggle, chain-order selector, persistent window geometry
- Meter ballistics match Phone/CW Level (30 ms attack, 180 ms release)

**DSP test harness**
- tests/client_comp_test.cpp — 11 standalone smoke tests: bypass,
  below-threshold passthrough, static ratio (4:1 and 20:1), makeup,
  limiter ceiling, stereo linking, attack timing, soft-knee monotonicity,
  transient sanity, reset(). Built as `client_comp_test` CMake target.

**Settings**
- Client EQ: ClientEq{Rx,Tx}_Enabled / ActiveBandCount, per-band
  ClientEq{Rx,Tx}_Band{N}_* (type, freq, gain, Q, slope, enabled),
  ClientEq{Rx,Tx}_FilterFamily, ClientEq{Rx,Tx}_MasterGain, plus
  ClientEqEditorGeometry
- Client Comp: ClientCompTx* keys (Enabled, ThresholdDb, Ratio,
  AttackMs, ReleaseMs, KneeDb, MakeupDb, LimEnabled, LimCeilingDb),
  ClientCompTxChainOrder, ClientCompEditorGeometry

**Docs**
- docs/tx-audio-signal-path.md — new "Client-side TX DSP" section
  showing mic → ClientEq + ClientComp → VITA-49 → radio firmware chain
- docs/architecture-pipelines.md — TX pipeline diagram shows
  applyClientTxDsp stage inserted between onTxAudioReady and the
  voice/DAX/RADE fork

Compressor Phase 2+ (expander/gate, de-esser, tube, enhancer, low
contour, IKA/IRC, lookahead limiter, preset system) tracked in #1661
for future releases.

## [v0.8.16] — 2026-04-18

### DIGI Applet Split, TCI Audio Reliability, PGXL-Aware S-Meter, Community Contributions

**VFO slider wheel leak (#547 BUG-002)**
- Sliders in VFO panel no longer leak wheel events to frequency scroll
- Scroll over frequency display tunes by step size
- Scroll elsewhere on VFO is consumed (dead zone)

**B/S zoom toggle (#547 ENH-001)**
- B and S buttons now toggle: first press zooms, second press restores

## [v0.7.17.3] — 2026-04-02

### Filter Widget, DSP Cleanup & Diagnostics

### New Features

**Visual filter passband widget**
- SmartSDR-style filter control in the RX applet with static trapezoid shape
- Horizontal drag shifts passband, vertical drag adjusts bandwidth
- Numeric labels: lo, hi, bandwidth, and center offset from carrier
- 50 Hz snap grid, minimum 50 Hz bandwidth
- Replaces the DSP toggle buttons in the RX applet

**Frequency reference status bar (#478)**
- Status bar shows actual frequency reference: GPS (with satellite count
  and lock status), Ext 10M, or TCXO
- No more perpetual "Warming" on radios without a GPS antenna
- Uses oscillator status messages from radio for accurate source detection

### Bug Fixes

**Stale process on exit (#527)**
- Suppress reconnect dialog during app shutdown — was keeping the
  process alive on Windows after the main window closed
- Added 3-second timeouts to all thread wait() calls in destructors

**DAX TX level meter (#517)**
- P/CW mic gauge now shows DAX TX input level when DAX is active
- Previously showed nothing because the mic input path returns early
  in DAX mode

**DSP toggles removed from RX applet**
- 9 buttons and 27 sync points eliminated between RxApplet, VfoWidget,
  and spectrum overlay
- DSP controls remain in VFO DSP tab and spectrum overlay menu
- Eliminates triple-state tracking bugs (NR/NR2, RNN/RN2)

---

## [v0.7.17.2] — 2026-04-01

### Bug Fixes & MIDI Improvements

AetherSDR v0.7.17.2 closes 6 user-reported issues, adds MIDI relative knob
support with acceleration, and improves digital mode workflow.

### Bug Fixes

**rigctld cross-band tune (#536)**
- `set_freq` now uses `tuneAndRecenter` so the panadapter follows when
  WSJT-X or other CAT apps change bands (was using `autopan=0`)

**Mouse 8x step on KDE/Cinnamon/Linux Mint (#504)**
- Clamp scroll wheel to ±1 step per event in all scroll handlers:
  SpectrumWidget (VFO tune), RxApplet (freq label), HGauge (TGXL relays)

**Slider labels stale on connect (#544)**
- VFO slider labels (AF Gain, SQL, AGC-T, Pan, ESC, APF) now update
  immediately when the radio pushes status on connect

**S-Meter frozen during TUNE (#491)**
- TUNE bypassed `m_txRequested` so the interlock TRANSMITTING state was
  rejected. S-Meter now switches to forward power during TUNE and MOX.
  Also fixes #499 (power meter no output)

**DAX auto-activate in digital modes (#534)**
- Radio-side DAX flag (`transmit set dax=1`) auto-toggles on mode change
  to/from DIGU/DIGL/RTTY — P/CW DAX button follows automatically
- Client-side DSP (NR2/RN2/BNR) auto-disabled in digital modes to
  prevent data signal corruption
- PipeWire bridge decoupled from DAX flag — use Settings → Auto Start DAX
  for persistent virtual audio devices

**Interlock timing fields not populated (#498)**
- RCA TX1, TX Delay, ACC TX, Timeout now show correct radio values in
  Radio Setup → TX tab (parser existed but was never wired up)

### New Features

**MIDI relative knob mode**
- Relative CC encoding support (1-63 CW, 65-127 CCW)
- 20ms coalesce timer batches rapid steps into single radio commands
- 3-tier acceleration: slow spin = ½ rate (fine tune), fast = 4×
- Snap to step grid (e.g. step=500 → x.x.500, x.x+1.000)
- Radio-authoritative step size — no default until radio sends step=
- "Relative" checkbox in MIDI Mapping dialog, persisted in midi.settings

---

## [v0.7.17.1] — 2026-04-01

### Accurate Network Diagnostics

AetherSDR v0.7.17.1 replaces application-layer RTT measurement with kernel
TCP stack timing, adds per-stream network diagnostics, and fixes DAX
stream lifecycle management.

### Improvements

**Kernel TCP_INFO RTT (#455)**
- RTT now read from the kernel's TCP congestion control (TCP_INFO),
  completely immune to Qt event loop delays
- Linux: `getsockopt(TCP_INFO)` → `tcpi_rtt`
- macOS: `getsockopt(TCP_CONNECTION_INFO)` → `tcpi_srtt`
- Windows: `WSAIoctl(SIO_TCP_INFO)` → `RttUs`
- Falls back to QElapsedTimer stopwatch if kernel call unavailable
- Fixes inflated RTT (40–200ms) that correlated with waterfall load

**Per-stream Network Diagnostics (#455)**
- Network Diagnostics dialog now shows per-stream-type rates:
  Audio, FFT, Waterfall, Meters, DAX
- Per-stream packet loss tracking with sequence error counts
- TX byte counter wired to actual UDP sends
- Total RX from raw socket byte counter
- Matches SmartSDR's reported RX rate (77 kbps on Opus)

**Packet loss accuracy (#455)**
- Sequence tracking moved after ownership filter — no longer counts
  other clients' streams in Multi-Flex mode
- Meter broadcast packets excluded (unreliable sequence counter)
- Eliminates false 28% packet loss reports

**DAX stream cleanup**
- Disabling DAX now sends `stream remove` to the radio and unregisters
  streams from PanadapterStream
- Previously DAX streams persisted until app restart

**Socket write flush**
- `flush()` after `write()` in RadioConnection ensures ping and
  command packets are sent immediately, not buffered by Qt

---

## [v0.7.17] — 2026-04-01

### Network & Input Responsiveness

AetherSDR v0.7.17 moves all network and external controller I/O off the main
thread, fixing ping RTT inflation and establishing a clean 5-thread architecture.

### Improvements

**RadioConnection worker thread (#502)**
- TCP command/status I/O runs on a dedicated worker thread
- Ping RTT now measures actual network latency, not main thread load
- Fixes "Poor" network status despite zero packet drops
- Response callbacks dispatched on main thread via auto-queued signals
- All external `connection()->sendCommand()` calls routed through RadioModel

**External controllers worker thread (#502)**
- FlexControl USB tuning knob, MIDI controllers, and serial port PTT/CW
  keying now run on a shared ExtControllers worker thread
- USB serial I/O, RtMidi callbacks, and poll timers no longer compete
  with GUI rendering for main thread CPU
- MIDI parameter dispatch via signal to main thread (thread-safe)

### Architecture

Five-thread design: Main (GUI + models), Connection (TCP), Audio (DSP),
Network (VITA-49 UDP), ExtControllers (FlexControl/MIDI/SerialPort).
Each worker thread has a single responsibility and communicates via
auto-queued Qt signals. The main thread handles only rendering and
model dispatch.

useful for operators worldwide with selectable IARU band plans.

### New Features

**Manual TGXL Pi Network Relay Control (#469)**
- Scroll over the C1, L, or C2 relay bars in the Tuner applet to adjust
  relay positions one step at a time
- AetherSDR auto-connects directly to the TGXL on TCP port 9010
- Real-time relay updates with ~3ms round-trip
- Cursor changes to ↕ when hovering over scrollable relay bars
- Protocol reverse-engineered from the 4O3A TGXL management app
- First SDR client to support manual TGXL relay control

**Selectable IARU Band Plans (#425)**
- View → Band Plan now includes a region selector:
  ARRL (US), IARU Region 1, Region 2, Region 3
- Region 1: Europe, Africa, Middle East (80m stops at 3.800, 40m at 7.200)
- Region 2: Americas (80m to 4.000, 40m to 7.300)
- Region 3: Asia-Pacific, Oceania (80m to 3.900, 40m to 7.200)
- Each plan includes segment allocations and spot frequency markers

### Bug Fixes & Improvements

**Default MTU reduced to 1450 (#470)**
- VITA-49 FFT/waterfall packets are 1436 bytes at MTU 1500, exceeding most
  VPN/SD-WAN tunnel MTUs (WireGuard 1420, OpenVPN 1400)
- Confirmed fix by user on Cisco Meraki SD-WAN
- Adjustable in Radio Setup → Network → Advanced

**FFTW thread safety for NR2 (#467)**
- Added mutex to serialize all FFTW plan creation/destruction
- Prevents potential crashes when switching DSP modes or regenerating wisdom
- `fftw_execute()` left unlocked (thread-safe per FFTW spec)

**Removed broken release.yml workflow**
- GitHub Actions release workflow removed (GITHUB_TOKEN PRs can't trigger CI)
- Ship/release now handled locally via Claude using gh CLI and GPG-signed tags

## [v0.7.15] — 2026-03-30

### Digital-Friendly Minimal Mode

AetherSDR v0.7.15 introduces **Minimal Mode** — a streamlined, ultra-compact
interface designed for digital mode operators who want AetherSDR running
alongside WSJT-X, fldigi, or other companion software without dominating
screen real estate.

### New Features

**Minimal Mode (#208)**
- Ctrl+M or ↙ button in the title bar collapses AetherSDR to a 260px-wide
  applet-only strip — just your VFO, RX controls, TX controls, and meters
- Spectrum, waterfall, and status bar are hidden; title bar goes compact
- ↗ button restores full mode instantly with splitter sizes preserved
- All applets remain available and fully functional
- Perfect for digital mode operation: park AetherSDR on one side of the screen
  while your decoder fills the rest

**multiFLEX Dashboard (#56)**
- Settings → multiFLEX opens a live dashboard showing all connected stations
- Per-client display: station name, program, TX antenna, TX frequency
- LOCAL PTT status with checkmarks and "Enable Local PTT" button
- multiFLEX enable/disable toggle
- Real-time updates via client status subscriptions

### Infrastructure

**CI/CD Pipeline**
- Docker-based CI builds in ~3.5 minutes (down from 3–19 min variable)
- CodeQL analysis runs in parallel without blocking merge
- `git ship` squashes local commits into single auto-merge PR
- `git release` automates version bump, changelog PR, tag, and release

## [v0.7.12] — 2026-03-29

### New Features

**GPG Release Signing (#397, #398)**
- Linux AppImage and source archives are GPG-signed with detached `.asc` signatures
- SHA256SUMS.txt generated and signed for each release
- macOS artifacts signed via Apple codesign + notarization (unchanged)
- Public key published at `docs/RELEASE-SIGNING-KEY.pub.asc` and keys.openpgp.org
- Verification guide at `docs/VERIFYING-RELEASES.md`

**Commit Signing**
- All commits to `main` require GPG signatures (branch protection enforced)
- Contributor setup guide in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Configurable Band Plan Size (#406)**
- View → Band Plan submenu: Off, Small (6pt), Medium (10pt), Large (12pt), Huge (16pt)
- Strip height scales with font size
- Replaces the previous on/off checkbox

**Visual Keyboard Shortcut Manager (#239)**
- View → Configure Shortcuts opens a visual keyboard map dialog
- Full ANSI keyboard layout with keys color-coded by action category
- Click any key to assign/change/clear its binding
- ~45 bindable actions across 12 categories (Frequency, Band, Mode, TX, Audio, Slice, Filter, Tuning, DSP, AGC, Display, RIT/XIT)
- Conflict detection with reassign prompt
- Filterable action table with search and category filter
- Reset to defaults (per-key or all)
- Bindings persist across restarts via AppSettings
- Replaces hardcoded keyboard shortcuts with fully customizable bindings

**Click-and-Drag VFO Tuning (#404)**
- Click inside the filter passband and drag left/right to tune the VFO
- Frequency snaps to step size during drag
- Filter edge drag (resize) takes priority within ±5px grab zone

**Go to Frequency (G key)**
- Press G to open the VFO direct frequency entry field
- Pre-fills with current frequency, selected for easy overtype

**Space PTT Hold-to-Transmit**
- Hold Space to transmit, release to return to RX (true momentary PTT)
- Works regardless of which UI widget has focus
- Properly syncs TX state with TX applet and status bar

### Bug Fixes

**NR2/RN2/BNR Crash on DSP Mode Switch**
- SEGV in SpectralNR::process() when switching from BNR to NR2
- Root cause: enabled flag was set before the DSP object was constructed; audio arriving during the transition called process() on a null object
- Fix: set enabled flag AFTER construction succeeds; clear flag BEFORE destruction

**FlexControl UI Lag (#379)**
- Each encoder step sent a separate TCP command, flooding the radio
- Fix: coalesce rapid encoder steps into a single command every 20ms

**FlexControl Menu Stub (#380)**
- Settings → FlexControl showed "not implemented"
- Fix: wired to open Radio Setup dialog on the Serial tab

**TNF Crash on +TNF Click (#381)**
- SIGBUS on macOS when clicking +TNF after a panadapter layout change
- Root cause: rebuildTnfMarkers lambda captured raw SpectrumWidget pointer that became dangling when the pan was removed
- Fix: capture QPointer instead; also fixed duplicate `tnf create` commands per click

**FlexControl ToggleMox/ToggleTune Stuck in TX (#382)**
- Pressing the FlexControl button a second time didn't toggle TX off
- Root cause: `applyTransmitStatus()` never parsed `mox=` from radio status, so `isMox()` always returned false
- Fix: parse `mox=` key in transmit status updates

**VFO Lock Icon Not Updating (#384)**
- Lock icon on VFO overlay didn't update when toggled via FlexControl or RxApplet
- Root cause: VfoWidget::setSlice() connected 30+ SliceModel signals but was missing `lockedChanged`
- Fix: added the missing signal connection

**Mouse Wheel 8x Step on KDE/Cinnamon (#390, #405)**
- Tuning steps were 8x the selected step size on Linux Mint, Cinnamon, and KDE Plasma
- Root cause: these desktops send high-resolution angleDelta (960 per notch instead of 120)
- Fix: accumulate angleDelta and normalize to 120 units per step

**ESC Gain Slider Black Thumb (#394)**
- ESC gain slider thumb was invisible (black) on macOS and Windows
- Root cause: kSliderStyle only defined horizontal handle rules; ESC gain slider is vertical
- Fix: added vertical groove and handle QSS rules

**RxApplet NR2 Button Not Working (#329)**
- Cycling the RX panel NR button to NR2 didn't enable noise reduction
- Root cause: the `nr2CycleToggled` handler only synced the VFO button visual but never called `enableNr2WithWisdom()`
- Fix: NR2 now actually enables when cycled from the RX panel, matching VFO and overlay buttons

**Split Slice on Wrong Pan (#328)**
- In multi-pan mode, clicking SPLIT could create the TX slice on the wrong panadapter
- Root cause: split used `m_activePanId` (global) instead of the RX slice's actual pan
- Fix: use `rxSlice->panId()` for the `slice create` command
- Bonus: CW split now offsets 1 kHz up (standard convention), other modes 5 kHz

## [v0.7.11] — 2026-03-29


### New Features

**Panadapter Click-to-Spot (#36)**
- Right-click on the panadapter to create a spot marker with callsign, comment, and configurable lifetime
- Optionally forward spots to your connected DX cluster
- Right-click on existing spots: Tune, Copy Callsign, QRZ Lookup, Remove
- Spot frequency snaps to tuning step size

**Per-Slice Record & Play (#164)**
- Record (⏺) and Play (▶) buttons on each VFO flag, matching SmartSDR placement
- Record button pulses red while recording
- Play disabled until a recording exists (radio-managed)
- TX playback: press MOX then Play for a built-in voice keyer

**DAX IQ Streaming (#124)**
- Raw I/Q data from the radio's DDC to external SDR apps (SDR#, GQRX, GNU Radio)
- 4 IQ channels at 24/48/96/192 kHz via PulseAudio virtual capture devices
- DIGI applet: per-channel rate dropdown, level meters, On/Off toggle
- Spectrum overlay: IQ channel routing selector per panadapter
- Dedicated worker thread for byte-swap and pipe I/O at high sample rates

**Applet Panel Collapse (#178)**
- ☰ hamburger icon in the status bar toggles the right applet panel
- Spectrum/waterfall expands to full width when panel is hidden
- Also available via View → Applet Panel checkbox
- Custom painted +PAN spectrum icon replaces text label

**Drag-Reorderable Applets (#335)**
- Drag applets by their ⋮⋮ grip title bars to reorder in the panel
- Order persists across sessions
- View → Reset Applet Order to restore defaults
- Built on QDrag framework (future-proofs for pop-out to floating windows)

**Opus Codec Independent of RADE (#375)**
- SmartLink compressed audio now works without the RADE digital voice module
- System libopus detected via pkg-config when RADE is disabled
- Windows: setup-opus.ps1 builds static opus from source

**Modeless Dialogs**
- SpotHub, Radio Setup, and MIDI Mapping dialogs no longer block the main window
- Interact with the radio while dialogs are open

### Bug Fixes

**BNR Crash Fix (#376)**
- r8brain resampler buffer overflow — BNR output can return up to 9,600 samples at once but the resampler was allocated for 4,096. Increased to 16,384. Found and verified via ASAN.

**AppSettings Corruption Prevention**
- Atomic save: write to .tmp file, validate XML, rename over original
- Backup recovery: auto-recover from .bak if main file is corrupt
- Count guard: refuse to save if settings count dropped below half of loaded count
- Key validation: skip keys with invalid XML element name characters

**RadioModel Shutdown Use-After-Free**
- Disconnect all signals from RadioConnection before member destruction
- Prevents accessing destroyed XVTR map and slice models during teardown
- Found via AddressSanitizer (ASAN) build

**Opus SSE Alignment**
- Copy input data to alignas(16) buffers before opus_encode/opus_decode
- Prevents SEGV on SSE-optimized RADE opus builds

**Spot Label Deconfliction**
- Re-scan all placed labels after each nudge to properly stack across all levels
- Spots no longer overlap when multiple labels are close in frequency

**Other Fixes**
- Duplicate spot-to-cluster sends fixed (disconnect before reconnect in wirePanadapter)
- DIGI applet section headers use distinct label style (not confused with draggable title bars)
- DIGI applet layout: CAT Control and DAX Enable rows moved below their channel status for cleaner visual flow

### Platform Notes

- DAX IQ pipe output is Linux/macOS only. Windows DAX IQ support tracked in #87.
- Opus standalone requires system libopus on Linux (`libopus-dev`) or macOS (`brew install opus`). Windows builds from source via setup-opus.ps1.

## [v0.7.10] — 2026-03-29


### TX Audio
- **PR #353 merged** — DAX/SSB TX edge sync fix from @pepefrog1234. Immediate SSB TX audio gating (no delay on key-down), DAX backlog stabilization, Low-Latency DAX route option for FreeDV (Settings menu toggle)
- **MIDI CW keying** — straight key (`cw.key`), iambic dit/dah paddles (`cw.dit`/`cw.dah`), and PTT hold (`cw.ptt`) via new Gate param type. CW speed also mappable. (#295)

### Spots
- **Hover tooltips** — hover over any spot label to see callsign, frequency, source, spotter, comment, and spotted time
- **Spot trigger on click** — clicking a spot sends `spot trigger <index>` to the radio so external logging software sees the click (#341)
- **Lines stop at label** — spot dotted lines draw from bottom of spectrum to the label only, no clutter above (#337)
- **Cross-band tuning** — clicking a spot on a different band in SpotHub now tunes AND recenters the panadapter (#352)

### Panadapter
- **3v / 4v layouts** — 3 and 4 vertical pan stacking options in the layout chooser (#312)
- **Single-click-to-tune** — configurable in View menu (off by default). When enabled, single left-click on spectrum/waterfall tunes immediately (#342)

### Bug Fixes
- **Line out volume** — master volume slider controls radio line out when PC Audio is disabled (#244, #351)
- **Audio preserved on profile change** — profile load no longer switches audio to PC when listening through radio speakers (#336)
- **CW decode after profile change** — deferred re-check restarts decoder when mode status arrives after profile load (#305)
- **XVTR band stack** — added 2m, 1.25m, 440, 33cm, 23cm to band frequency lookup. Band stack save/restore now works for all XVTR bands (#346)
- **Full model reset on disconnect** — all radio-specific state (APD, tuner, amplifier, XVTR, power levels) resets when switching between different radio models (#359)
- **Bundled RtMidi** — MIDI controller support works on all platforms (Linux/macOS/Windows) without external package dependency

### Issues Closed

## [v0.7.9] — 2026-03-29


### Highlights

- **MIDI controller mapping** — Map any class-compliant USB MIDI controller to 50+ AetherSDR parameters. MIDI Learn mode: select a parameter, move a knob, binding created. Dedicated Settings → MIDI Mapping dialog with device selector, binding table, activity indicator, and named profiles. Supports CC (knobs/faders), Note On/Off (buttons/pads), and Pitch Bend (high-res tuning). CW straight key, iambic dit/dah paddle, and PTT via MIDI Gate parameters. Bindings stored in dedicated `~/.config/AetherSDR/midi.settings` XML file. Optional dependency (RtMidi). (#355, #295)

## [v0.7.7] — 2026-03-28


**AetherSDR v0.7.7 introduces SpotHub** — a completely new, unified spot management system that brings DX spotting to Linux ham radio like never before. Four spot sources. One panadapter. Zero external tools required.

---

## Introducing SpotHub

Gone are the days of running separate Python scripts, telnet clients, and browser tabs just to see who's on the air. SpotHub brings it all together in a single dialog (**Settings → SpotHub**) with six tabs:

### DX Cluster
Connect to any DX Spider, AR-Cluster, or CC Cluster node via telnet. Full interactive console with command input. See every spot the moment it hits the cluster — right on your panadapter.

### Reverse Beacon Network (RBN)
Automated CW/RTTY/FT8 skimmer spots from the worldwide RBN network. Built-in rate limiting prevents command flooding during contests. Connect to `telnet.reversebeacon.net` and let the skimmers do the work.

### WSJT-X Decode Spotter
**This is the big one.** AetherSDR listens for WSJT-X decode messages via UDP multicast and spots every station you can hear — directly on the panadapter. Features:
- **Smart filters**: Show only CQ calls, CQ POTA, or stations calling *you*
- **Color-coded by category**: Green for CQ, Cyan for CQ POTA, Red for stations calling you
- **SNR-based transparency**: Strong signals pop with full opacity, weak ones fade — you see propagation at a glance
- **Configurable lifetime**: 30-300 second spot decay, tuned for the fast pace of digital modes

### POTA (Parks on the Air)
Real-time POTA activation feed polling `api.pota.app`. See every active park activation on your panadapter with park reference, park name, and mode. Spot lifetime synced to the POTA API's own expiry timer. Never miss an activator again.

### Spot List
All spots from all sources in one sortable, filterable table. Band filter checkboxes (160m-6m). Source column tells you where each spot came from. Double-click any row to tune. Smart auto-scroll that pauses when you're reading and resumes when you scroll back.

### Display Controls
Full control over how spots render on the panadapter: label levels, position, font size, colors, background opacity, and spot lifetime.

---

## Per-Source Color Coding

Every spot source has its own configurable color:

| Source | Default Color | What You See |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| DX Cluster | Tan | Classic cluster spots |
| RBN | Blue | Skimmer detections |
| WSJT-X | Green/Cyan/Red/White | Per-filter category colors |
| POTA | Yellow | Park activations |

Colors are sent to the radio via the FlexRadio spot API — they render natively on the panadapter with no client-side override needed.

## Spot Density Badges

When spots pile up (and they will), overlapping labels collapse into amber **+N** badges. Click a badge to expand a popup showing every collapsed callsign with its frequency. Click any entry to tune. No more unreadable label soup.

## Deduplication

Cross-source dedup ensures the same callsign on the same frequency doesn't flood your panadapter. If a station QSYs, the old spot is replaced. Each source uses its own appropriate lifetime for dedup timing.

## Worker Thread Architecture

All four spot sources run on a dedicated worker thread. Network I/O, protocol parsing, and log file writing happen completely off the main GUI thread. Spots are batched and forwarded to the radio once per second — smooth, efficient, and invisible.

---

## Other Fixes in This Release

- **SmartLink reconnect fix** (#224) — Signal connection leak that prevented switching between SmartLink radios
- **Version in title bar** (#315) — Window title now shows "AetherSDR vX.X.X"
- **Spot label hover cursor** — Pointing hand cursor on spot labels and density badges

---

## Upgrade Notes

Drop-in replacement for v0.7.6.x. No new required dependencies. SpotHub settings are saved to `~/.config/AetherSDR/AetherSDR.settings` on first use.

## [v0.7.6.1] — 2026-03-28

## Bug Fix

- **Fix SmartLink reconnect signal leak** — `WanConnection` signal connections in `RadioModel::connectViaWan()` were never disconnected on teardown, causing duplicate signal delivery on each reconnect cycle. This prevented users from switching between SmartLink radios or cleanly disconnecting and reconnecting. (#224)

## Upgrade

Drop-in replacement for v0.7.6. No new dependencies or settings changes.

## [v0.7.6] — 2026-03-27

## Highlights

### NVIDIA NIM BNR — GPU-Accelerated AI Noise Removal (#288)

**A world first for SDR clients.** AetherSDR v0.7.6 introduces real-time GPU-accelerated neural noise removal powered by NVIDIA Maxine BNR, running on your local RTX GPU via a self-hosted Docker container.

- **Neural denoising** trained on massive audio datasets — superior to classical spectral (NR2) and RNNoise (RN2) approaches
- **Real-time gRPC streaming** — 48kHz mono float32, 10ms processing chunks, ~15ms total added latency
- **Intensity control** — adjustable denoising strength (0–100%) via slider in DSP panel
- **Jitter buffer** — 50ms priming for smooth, uninterrupted playback
- **Container management** — Start/Stop/Status in Radio Setup → Audio, optional autostart on app launch
- **Zero-config audio** — BNR button in VFO DSP tab and spectrum overlay, 3-way mutual exclusion with NR2/RN2

**Requirements:** NVIDIA RTX 4000+ GPU (Ada Lovelace or newer), Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit, NGC API key (free).

```bash
docker login nvcr.io  # Username: $oauthtoken, Password: <NGC API key>
docker run -d --gpus all --shm-size=8gb \
  -p 8001:8001 -p 8000:8000 \
  -e NGC_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY \
  -e STREAMING=true \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --name maxine-bnr \
  nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/maxine-bnr:latest

cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DENABLE_BNR=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

### ESC Diversity Beamforming (#20, #38)

- **DIV toggle** in VFO audio tab enables dual-SCU diversity reception
- **ESC controls** — polar display (phase=angle, gain=radius), horizontal phase slider (0–360° in 5° steps), vertical gain slider (0.0–2.0)
- **Real-time ESC meter** — signal strength bar after ESC processing
- Protocol verified against SmartSDR pcap: `esc=on/off`, phase in radians, DiversityChild guard per FlexLib
- Requires DIV_ESC license (SmartSDR+) and dual-SCU radio

### Band Zoom Buttons

- **S** (Segment) and **B** (Band) buttons at bottom-left of waterfall
- Uses radio-native `segment_zoom=1` / `band_zoom=1` commands (SmartSDR protocol)

## Bug Fixes

- **XVTR band switch crash** — QPointer prevents SEGV when panadapter destroyed during band change
- **CW decoder not working on first pan** — initial applet wasn't wired through setActivePanApplet()
- **Band change panadapter not scrolling** — use tuneAndRecenter() instead of autopan=0
- **VFO widget not shrinking** — fixed setFixedWidth constraining height when ESC panel hidden
- **Null pointer guards** — m_panApplet checked before setCwPanelVisible() calls

## Build

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DENABLE_BNR=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

## [v0.7.5] — 2026-03-27

## What's New

### ESC (Enhanced Signal Clarity) — Diversity Beamforming (#20, #38)
- **DIV toggle** in VFO audio tab enables dual-SCU diversity reception
- **ESC controls**: toggle button, horizontal phase slider (0–360° in 5° steps), vertical gain slider (0.0–2.0)
- **Polar display**: crosshair circle with dot positioned by phase (angle) and gain (radius from center)
- **Real-time ESC meter**: signal strength bar after ESC processing (SLC/ESC meter, 10 fps)
- Protocol matches SmartSDR pcap: `esc=on/off`, phase in radians, DiversityChild guard per FlexLib
- ESC panel visible only on diversity parent slice — child slices show DIV but not ESC controls
- Requires DIV_ESC feature license (SmartSDR+ or higher)
- Dual-SCU radios only: FLEX-8600(M), FLEX-6700(R), FLEX-6600(M), AU-520(M)

### Bug Fixes
- **Band change panadapter scroll**: switching bands now recenters the panadapter on the new frequency (was sending `autopan=0` which prevented scrolling)
- **VFO widget resize**: panel properly shrinks when DIV is disabled (fixed `setFixedWidth` constraining height)

## Install
Download the appropriate package for your platform from the assets below, or build from source:
```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
./build/AetherSDR
```

## [v0.7.4] — 2026-03-26

## What's New in v0.7.4

### VOX Support — #253
AetherSDR now creates a `remote_audio_tx` stream on connect and continuously streams mic audio to the radio during RX. This enables the radio's VOX (Voice-Operated Transmit) detection via `met_in_rx=1`.

Previously, only `dax_tx` streams were created and mic audio was only sent during active transmit — so VOX had no audio to monitor and could never trigger.

The DAX TX path is unchanged (only sends during active transmit to prevent mic bleed into digital modes). VOX audio flows on a separate `remote_audio_tx` stream with its own accumulator.

### Profile Load Fix — #289
Applying a global profile no longer causes the FFT spectrum to disappear. The radio resets `x_pixels`/`y_pixels` to defaults during profile application — AetherSDR now detects this and automatically re-pushes correct widget dimensions.

### Band Stack Alignment Fix — #279, #291
Removed bandwidth and center from band stack save/restore. Both are radio-authoritative per FlexLib API — pushing stale saved values caused FFT/waterfall horizontal misalignment on band changes. Only dBm scale (a client display preference) is persisted.

## [v0.7.3.1] — 2026-03-26

## v0.7.3.1 Hotfix

Fixes two regressions introduced in v0.7.3:

### Profile Load Blank Spectrum — #289
Applying a global profile caused the FFT spectrum to disappear. The radio resets `x_pixels`/`y_pixels` to defaults (50/20) during profile application, overwriting our correct widget dimensions. Now automatically detects when the radio reports small pixel values in status and re-pushes the actual widget dimensions.

### FFT/Waterfall Alignment on Band Change — #279, #291
Switching bands caused horizontal misalignment between FFT spectrum and waterfall. The band stack was saving and restoring **bandwidth** (a radio-authoritative setting per FlexLib API), which overrode the radio's bandwidth and created a timing mismatch. Removed bandwidth and center from band stack persistence — only dBm scale (a client-side display preference) is saved/restored.

### Also included from v0.7.3 post-release
- Title bar speaker mute now controls local PC audio engine (#259)
- VFO tab bar speaker icon toggles muted/unmuted on right-click (#283)

## [v0.7.3] — 2026-03-26

## What's New in v0.7.3

### DVK (Digital Voice Keyer) — #19
- **12-slot recording panel** with F1-F12 hotkeys, REC/STOP/PLAY/PREV buttons
- **Elapsed timer** with 100ms resolution and per-slot progress bars (red/green/blue by operation)
- **Right-click context menu**: Rename, Clear, Delete, Import WAV, Export WAV
- **Inline name editing** via double-click, with forbidden character stripping
- **WAV export** (download): reverse TCP transfer from radio to local file
- **WAV import** (upload): validates format (2-ch, 32-bit float, 48 kHz, max 5 MB), TCP streaming to radio
- **Mode-aware availability**: DVK enabled only in voice modes (USB/LSB/AM/SAM/FM/NFM/DFM)
- **Empty slot guards**: prevents TX on empty slots, disables Clear/Delete/Export for empty slots

### CWX/DVK Panel Management
- CWX enabled only in CW/CWL modes, DVK only in voice modes
- Three indicator states: active (cyan), available (dim), unavailable (dark grey)
- Auto-close on mode switch, mutual exclusion between panels
- 4-pane splitter layout fix (CWX + DVK + PanStack + AppletPanel) — #281

### FFT/Waterfall Alignment Fix — #279
- Removed hardcoded xpixels=1024 in RadioModel::configurePan() that overwrote correct widget dimensions
- FFT spectrum and native waterfall tiles now align horizontally at all window sizes

### FFT dBm Calibration Fix
- Bin conversion now uses actual y_pixels from radio status (bins are pixel Y positions, not 0-65535)
- Tracks y_pixels from radio status updates for correct dBm scaling across different display sizes

### Mute Controls — #259, #283
- **Title bar speaker button** now mutes local PC audio engine (was only muting radio line out)
- **VFO tab bar speaker icon** toggles between muted/unmuted to show mute state at a glance
- **Right-click speaker icon** on VFO tab bar toggles mute directly (matches SmartSDR)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/compare/v0.7.2...v0.7.3

---

## [v0.7.2] — 2026-03-25

## Bug Fixes

- **Per-slice step size from radio** (#274, #241) — Step size and step list are now driven entirely by the radio's per-slice, per-mode status. The RX applet stepper dynamically rebuilds when switching slices or modes. Removed client-side step overwrite that was fighting the radio's mode-specific defaults.

- **Antenna Genius discovery retry** — If the UDP port 9007 bind fails at startup (e.g. another process holds the port), AetherSDR now retries every 5 seconds until it succeeds. Once detected, the AG persists for the app lifetime. Previously a failed bind meant the AG was never detected.

## Policy

- **Radio-authoritative settings** — Documented and enforced the policy that the radio is always authoritative for any setting it stores. AetherSDR only persists client-side settings the radio doesn't know about. This prevents the radio and client from fighting on reconnect.

## [v0.7.1] — 2026-03-25


Bug fixes, multi-pan stability improvements, and new CW/spot controls.

### Multi-Pan Improvements
- **Radio-authoritative pan restore** — radio restores pans from GUIClientID session, client arranges layout (no more creating/removing pans on startup)
- **Close pan via X button** — click the X on any pan's title bar to close it and auto-rearrange remaining pans
- **Defensive xpixels re-push** — 500ms delayed re-push ensures all pans get proper FFT bin resolution after connect
- **TGXL/PGXL meter separation** — meters routed by amplifier handle so TGXL and PGXL gauges don't cross-contaminate

### CW Decoder Controls
- **Lock Pitch** button — prevents decoder from wandering to noise after finding the CW tone
- **Lock Speed** button — locks WPM to current detected value
- **Pitch Range sliders** (Lo/Hi) — constrain decoder frequency search window (300-1200 Hz)
- **Numeric Hz labels** on pitch range sliders with dynamic tooltips

### Spot Settings Enhancements (#260)
- **Color picker** for spot text override color
- **Color picker** for spot background override color
- **Background Opacity** slider (0-100)
- **Live preview** — all changes apply immediately to the spectrum

### Bug Fixes
- **macOS trackpad scroll-to-tune** (#266) — handle pixelDelta for trackpad, ignore momentum scrolling
- **FWDPWR/SWR meter source** (#233) — match "TX-" not just "TX" for exciter power
- **S-Meter TX power with PGXL** — shows amplifier output power when PGXL is connected
- **Title bar mute toggles** (#259) — click speaker/headphone icons to mute/unmute line out and headphones
- **Filter polarity normalization** — DIGU/USB modes correct negative filter offsets from radio session restore
- **Band stack filter recall** — only recalls filter when saved mode matches recalled mode

### Known Issues
- CW sidetone not yet available through PC Audio (radio sends sidetone to physical outputs only, client-side generation deferred)
- `sub codec all` subscription rejected on firmware v4.1.5 (harmless)

## [v0.6.2] — 2026-03-24


## Band Stacking Registers

Per-band save/recall is here. When you switch bands using the spectrum overlay, AetherSDR remembers your last settings and restores them when you come back.

**Saved per band:** frequency, mode, AGC mode + threshold, RX/TX antenna, squelch, step size, all DSP flags (NR, NB, ANF, NRL, NRS, RNN, NRF, ANFL, ANFT, APF, NR2, RN2), pan bandwidth (zoom), and dBm scale.

First visit to a band uses the static default. Subsequent visits recall your last settings. Settings persist across restarts.

## Multi-Pan Improvements

- **Per-pan band change** — each pan's band buttons now target the correct slice, not the global active slice
- **Pan recenters on band change** — FFT/waterfall follows the VFO when switching bands across pans
- **Correct slice labels** — each pan shows the right slice letter (A, B, C, D)
- **Cross-band save guard** — prevents frequency contamination between bands in multi-pan mode
- **Widget cleanup on pan removal** — prevents crashes when reducing pan layouts

## Per-Slice Step Size

The radio sends per-slice step sizes and step lists (different for CW vs SSB vs digital). AetherSDR now parses these and syncs the RX applet stepper when switching between slices. The correct step list is shown per mode.

## New Features

- **Frequency auto-calibration** — Radio Setup → RX tab: Cal Frequency field + Start button + Offset display
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — View → Keyboard Shortcuts (off by default): arrow keys, step cycle, PTT, mute, tune lock
- **DX spot display** — spots from external tools (FlexSpots, N1MM, etc.) appear as clickable labels on the panadapter
- **Spot click-to-tune** — click a spot label to tune to that frequency
- **Spot settings** — Settings → Spots: enable/disable, font size, max stacking levels, color overrides

## Bug Fixes

- Fix GCC 13 internal compiler error on Ubuntu 24.04 (#254)
- Fix filter polarity on session restore (wrong-side passband for DIGU/USB)
- Fix FWDPWR/SWR meter on all radios — source matching was too strict (#233)
- Fix TGXL handle: accept initial 0x00000000 and upgrade to real handle
- Fix SmartLink: use UPnP ports when manual port forwards are absent (#230)
- Fix preamp sync: shared antenna hardware state propagated to all pans (#232)
- Fix crash in mhzToX during band transitions (divide by zero with spots visible)
- Fix Windows support bundle: resolve symlink to actual log file (#243)
- Fix memory recall to use per-pan commands (#236)
- Improved log file handling and diagnostics

### DX Spot Display (#228)
- **Spot markers on panadapter** — colored callsign labels at spotted frequencies with dotted tick lines
- **Click-to-tune** — click any spot label to tune to that frequency
- **Settings → Spots** — full control: enable/disable, font size, max stacking levels, vertical position, color override, clear all
- Works with FlexSpots, N1MM+, DXLabs, or any tool that sends `spot add` to the radio

### Keyboard Shortcuts (#234)
- **View → Keyboard Shortcuts** to enable (off by default for safety)
- Left/Right: nudge frequency by step size
- Shift+Left/Right: nudge by 10× step
- Up/Down: AF gain ±5
- T: toggle MOX | M: toggle mute | L: toggle tune lock
- [ / ]: cycle step size

### Frequency Calibration (#201)
- Radio Setup → RX tab: Cal Frequency field, Start button, Freq Offset (ppb) display
- Pre-populated from radio's `cal_freq` on connect

## Bug Fixes

- **Fix FWDPWR/SWR meter reading zero on all radios** (#233) — meter source is `TX-` not `TX`, broke in v0.5.8 PGXL fix
- **Fix SmartLink connection on UPnP radios** (#230) — now parses `public_upnp_tls_port`/`public_upnp_udp_port` (was connecting to port 65535)
- **Fix TGXL buttons not working** — handle was stuck at 0x00000000 from initial status, now upgrades to real handle
- **Fix preamp sync in Multi-Flex** (#232) — antenna preamp is shared hardware, now applied to all pans regardless of client
- **Fix VFO NR2 button not working** (#227) — connections now permanent per-VFO, not re-wired on focus switch
- **Fix scroll-to-tune only going one direction** — same-pan tuning uses immediate model update path
- **Fix crash on pan removal with active spots** — spot rebuild lambda now guarded with QPointer
- **Fix Windows support bundle** (#243) — resolves .lnk symlink to actual log file

## Multi-Pan Improvements

- Per-pan bandwidth, center, and dBm range drag commands (#236) — drags on one pan no longer affect other pans
- Layout restore on reconnect uses `applyPanLayout` to handle pan count mismatch from split mode

## [v0.6.0] — 2026-03-24


**Multi-pan is here!** This release introduces experimental support for multiple simultaneous panadapters on FlexRadio transceivers.

> ⚠️ **Experimental Feature** — Multi-panadapter support is functional but still under active development. Some interactions between pans may behave unexpectedly. We need your help testing and finding bugs. Please report any issues you encounter on the [Issues](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/issues) page.

## Multi-Panadapter Highlights

- **Layout Picker** — click +PAN in the status bar to choose from available layout options:
  - A / B (2 vertical), A | B (2 horizontal)
  - A|B / C (2 top + 1 bottom), A / B|C (1 top + 2 bottom)
  - A|B / C|D (2×2 grid), Single (1 pan)
- **Independent FFT + waterfall** per pan with native VITA-49 tile routing
- **Independent display settings** per pan (AVG, FPS, fill, gain, black level)
- **Click-to-tune** uses SmartSDR protocol (`slice m <freq> pan=<panId>`)
- **Layout persistence** — saved across restarts
- **Pan reduction** — switch from more pans to fewer, excess pans close automatically
- Dual-SCU radios (FLEX-6600/6700/8600, AU-520): up to 4 pans
- Single-SCU radios (FLEX-6400/8400, AU-510): up to 2 pans

## Other New Features

- **Heartbeat indicator** — title bar circle flashes green on each TCP ping, blinks red on missed beats
- **Keepalive ping** — sends `keepalive enable` + 1s ping timer (matches FlexLib protocol)
- **Reconnect dialog** — "Radio disconnected — Waiting for reconnect" on unexpected disconnect with auto-reconnect
- **Fast disconnect detection** — 5s discovery stale timeout with TCP ping fallback for routed/SmartLink
- **Low Bandwidth Connect** — connection panel checkbox for VPN/LTE/metered connections
- **PA inhibit during TUNE** — opt-in safety feature disables ACC TX output before tune, restores after
- **VFO TX badge toggle** — click to assign OR unassign TX from any slice
- **TGXL OPERATE disables TUNE/ATU/MEM** — TX applet buttons dimmed when external tuner is in OPERATE mode
- **VFO slider value labels** — AF gain, SQL, AGC-T show numeric values
- **RIT/XIT offset lines** — dashed lines on panadapter showing actual RX/TX frequencies
- **RTTY mark/space lines** — dashed M/S frequency lines on panadapter in RTTY mode
- **Multi-Flex indicator** — green "multiFLEX" badge in title bar with hover tooltip
- **Step size persistence** — tuning step saved across restarts
- **RTTY mark default from radio** — reads radio's value on connect
- **Show TX in Waterfall** — waterfall freezes during TX when disabled, multi-pan aware
- **Network MTU setting** — Radio Setup → Network → Advanced
- **XVTR panel** — 2×4 grid with auto-grow for configured bands
- **Fill slider label fix** — display panel Fill slider updates label
- **Additional protocol subscriptions** — cwx, dax, daxiq, radio, codec, dvk, usb_cable, spot, license

## Bug Fixes

- Fix volume slider sync: parse `audio_level` not `audio_gain` (#161)
- Fix exciter forward power disappearing when PGXL connected (#181)
- Fix NR2/RN2 button sync between spectrum overlay, VFO, and RX applet
- Fix NR2 freeze: spectrum overlay bypassed FFTW wisdom generation (#214)
- Fix crash on exit: proper MainWindow destructor stops DSP before teardown (#167)
- Fix SQL button showing enabled in digital modes (#192)
- Fix TNF toggle sending no command (#184)
- Fix FDX toggle: optimistic update since radio doesn't echo status (#188)
- Fix DAX channel not persisting (#180)
- Fix profile save overwrite UX (#177)

## Protocol Discoveries (SmartSDR pcap analysis)

- SmartSDR **never sends `slice set <id> active=1`** — active slice is client-side only
- Click-to-tune uses `slice m <freq> pan=<panId>` with radio-side slice routing
- Per-pan `xpixels/ypixels` must be pushed after creation (radio defaults to 50×20)
- Waterfall tiles use stream ID 0x42xxxxxx (distinct from FFT's 0x40xxxxxx)
- `keepalive enable` + `ping ms_timestamp=` every 1 second

## Known Multi-Pan Issues

- Bandwidth drag may affect rates on other pans (#236)
- Split mode interaction with multi-pan needs further testing
- Per-pan display settings are not pushed on reconnect (second pan gets radio defaults)
- Visual stepping when adding pans (pans appear one at a time before rearranging)

- **PA temp/voltage precision** (#195): XX.X°C and XX.XX V

### Improvements
- **macOS mic permission** (#157): proper `AVAuthorizationStatus` check with diagnostic logging
- **APD visibility**: hidden on radios that don't support it
- **FDX indicator**: matches TNF/CWX/DVK font size (24px)
- **Disabled button style**: reusable `kDisabledBtn` for dimmed non-clickable buttons

### Protocol
- Added `sub client all` subscription for real-time Multi-Flex client tracking
- Client disconnect status parsing (`client <handle> disconnected`)

## SmartLink Remote Operation — Now Working!

Operate your FlexRadio over the internet from Linux. Connect via SmartLink and get full spectrum, waterfall, audio, and meters — just like being on the local network.

### What's new

- **SmartLink VITA-49 UDP streaming** — FFT spectrum, waterfall tiles, RX audio (float32 stereo), and meter data now stream over WAN. Previously only the TLS command channel worked; now the full receive path is functional.
- **WAN UDP registration protocol** — Implements FlexLib's `client udp_register handle=0x<HANDLE>` sent via UDP datagram (not TCP `client udpport`, which the radio rejects on WAN connections with error `0x500000AA`).
- **NAT pinhole keepalive** — Sends `client ping handle=0x<HANDLE>` via UDP every 5 seconds to maintain the NAT mapping for sustained remote sessions.
- **Pre-bound UDP socket** — Binds the VITA-49 UDP port before requesting SmartLink connection, passing `hole_punch_port` to the relay server so the radio knows where to send packets.
- **SmartLink debug logging** — Comprehensive logging across the full WAN connection flow (Auth0, SmartLink server, TLS handshake, UDP registration, VITA-49 packet arrival) for troubleshooting.
- **Fixed log file path** — Logs now write to `~/.config/AetherSDR/aethersdr.log` (was double-nested).
- **macOS DAX virtual audio bridge** (PR #93) — CoreAudio HAL plugin for DAX audio devices on macOS.
- **Fixed low SSB voice TX level** (PR #94) — +24 dB gain compensation for USB mic input.

### SmartLink requirements

- FlexRadio with SmartSDR+ subscription
- UPnP enabled on the radio's router (or manual UDP port forwarding for port 4993)
- NAT hole-punching for radios without UPnP is not yet implemented

### Known limitations

- Audio may be jittery on high-latency connections (jitter buffer not yet implemented)
- Opus compressed audio (PCC 0x8005) not yet supported — uses uncompressed float32 (~384 kbps)
- No WAN auto-reconnect on connection loss

### Tested

FLEX-8600 fw v4.1.5 via SmartLink with UPnP — all four VITA-49 stream types confirmed working (FFT 0x8003, waterfall 0x8004, audio 0x03E3, meters 0x8002) at ~330 KB/s sustained.

### PC Audio Toggle
New **PC** button on the VFO widget audio tab controls whether audio plays through your PC speakers or the radio's physical outputs (line out, headphone, front speaker).

- **PC ON** (green, default) — audio streams to your PC via `remote_audio_rx`
- **PC OFF** (grey) — audio plays through the radio's line out / headphone / front speaker

This fixes the issue where users with powered speakers connected to the radio's line out jack couldn't hear audio (#71). The radio mutes its physical outputs when a `remote_audio_rx` stream is active — toggling PC Audio OFF removes that stream.

The setting persists across sessions.

### Also in this release
- 48kHz audio fallback for devices that don't support 24kHz
- AppImage rebuilt with Qt 6.7 via aqtinstall (fixes Ubuntu audio)
- Windows build bundles libfftw3-3.dll (#81)
- XVTR band sub-menu and context-aware frequency entry
- Direct frequency entry (double-click frequency display)
- NR2 UX improvements (3-state NR button, wisdom dialog)
- 4O3A Antenna Genius support (@EI6JGB)

## [v0.4.10] — 2026-03-18


### Critical: Audio Fix for Ubuntu/Debian
- **AppImage rebuilt with Qt 6.7 via aqtinstall on Ubuntu 22.04 base** — fixes empty audio device dropdowns and no audio output on Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12+, and other modern distros
- Root cause: Ubuntu 22.04's Qt 6.2.4 had no separate multimedia plugin — linuxdeploy couldn't bundle it. Now using Qt 6.7.3 which ships the multimedia backend as a proper loadable plugin
- Bundles GStreamer audio plugins (pulseaudio, alsa, pipewire) directly in the AppImage
- **48kHz fallback**: AudioEngine now automatically upsamples RX (24k→48k) and downsamples TX (48k→24k) for devices that don't natively support 24kHz
- Diagnosed with help from a second Claude instance running inside an Ubuntu 24.04 VM

### XVTR Transverter Support
- XVTR button in band grid opens transverter sub-panel with configured bands
- "HF" button returns to regular band grid
- Context-aware frequency entry: on XVTR bands, bare integers get decimal after 3rd digit (1446 → 144.6 MHz)

### Direct Frequency Entry
- Double-click the frequency display (VFO widget or RX applet) to type a frequency
- Accepts: 14.225 (MHz), 14225 (kHz), 14225000 (Hz), 14.225.000 (dotted)

### NR2 UX Improvements
- 3-state NR button: Off → NR → NR2 → Off
- FFTW wisdom dialog: progress after each plan, breathing animation, auto-close messaging

### Windows Fix
- Bundle `libfftw3-3.dll` in Windows ZIP (fixes #81)

### 4O3A Antenna Genius Support (contributed by @EI6JGB)
- UDP discovery, TCP control, per-port antenna grid, band→antenna memory

## [v0.4.9] — 2026-03-18


### AppImage Audio Fix (Ubuntu/Debian)
The AppImage now bundles GStreamer and PipeWire multimedia plugins. This fixes the no-audio issue reported on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (#75) where the PC audio device list was empty despite system audio working normally.

### Firmware Update Staging
New staged firmware update workflow in Settings → Radio Setup → Radio tab:
- **Check for Update** queries FlexRadio's website and compares versions
- **Download** fetches the SmartSDR installer, verifies MD5 against published hash
- **Extract** carves the .ssdr firmware file from the installer binary
- **Validate** checks the extracted file header before enabling upload
- **Browse .ssdr** still available for manual file selection
- Experimental feature — disclaimer included

### NR2 UX Polish
- 3-state NR button cycle in RX Applet: Off → NR → NR2 → Off
- NR2 toggle added to DSP side panel
- All NR2 buttons sync bidirectionally
- Buttons only show "on" after wisdom generation completes
- FFTW wisdom dialog: progress reports after each plan, breathing animation, auto-close messaging

### Platform Firmware Mapping
All consumer FlexRadios (Microburst/DeepEddy/BigBend/Aurora) use FLEX-6x00 firmware. Only DragonFire (FLEX-9600) uses separate firmware.

## [v0.4.7a] — 2026-03-18


Minor UX improvements to the NR2 spectral noise reduction feature introduced in v0.4.7.

### NR Button 3-State Cycle
The NR button in the RX Applet now cycles through three states:
- **Off** → click → **NR** (radio-side noise reduction)
- **NR** → click → **NR2** (client-side spectral noise reduction)
- **NR2** → click → **Off**

The button label changes to show which mode is active. NR and NR2 are never on simultaneously — the radio's NR is automatically disabled when switching to NR2.

### Wisdom Dialog Improvements
- Progress bar now advances **after** each FFT plan completes, not before — no more false 100% while the last plan is still computing
- Description label shows which plan is being computed during slow phases ("Computing COMPLEX-TO-REAL FFT size 262144...")
- Breathing opacity animation on the dialog when progress >= 90% (the slow phase) so users know it's still working
- "Wisdom generation complete!" confirmation before auto-close
- Light text on progress bar readable at all fill levels

### NR2 Button Sync
All three NR2 controls (VFO widget, DSP side panel, RxApplet) now stay in sync and only show "on" after wisdom generation completes and NR2 is actually processing audio.

### DSP Side Panel
- NR2 toggle button added to the left-side DSP overlay panel
- DSP panel top-aligned with button menu

### Downloads
Pre-built binaries auto-attach when CI completes (~5 min).

## [v0.4.7] — 2026-03-18


### NR2 Spectral Noise Reduction (contributed by @EI6JGB)

Client-side spectral noise reduction using the Ephraim-Malah MMSE Log-Spectral Amplitude estimator with OSMS noise floor tracking. This is a sophisticated DSP algorithm that complements the radio's built-in NR — particularly effective on weak signals where the radio's NR alone isn't enough.

**Features:**
- Toggle NR2 in the VFO widget DSP panel
- FFTW3 optimized FFTs with automatic radix-2 fallback when FFTW3 isn't installed
- Background FFTW wisdom generation — audio continues playing during optimization
- 1-second startup ramp for smooth transition as the noise estimator converges
- Anti-musical-noise temporal gain smoothing
- Decision-directed a priori SNR estimation with speech presence probability
- CPU cost: ~1-2% of one core at 24kHz mono processing

**Dependencies (optional):**
- Linux: `libfftw3-dev` (falls back to built-in FFT without it)
- macOS: `brew install fftw`
- Windows: bundled in `third_party/fftw3/`

Thank you @EI6JGB for this excellent contribution — real DSP engineering with proper overlap-add processing, Hann windowing, and numerical stability.

### Firmware Uploader

Update your radio's firmware directly from Linux — no Windows machine required.

- Settings → Radio Setup → Radio tab → Firmware Update section
- Browse for .ssdr firmware files
- Progress bar with chunked TCP upload
- Confirmation dialog with model verification
- Automatic port fallback (4995 → 42607)

The .ssdr files can be obtained from an existing SmartSDR installation (`C:\ProgramData\FlexRadio Systems\SmartSDR\Updates\`).

## [v0.3.90-beta] — 2026-03-17


**This is a beta release.** SmartLink TCP command channel is fully working. UDP streaming (FFT, waterfall, audio) needs community testing.

### What's New: SmartLink

Operate your FlexRadio remotely over the internet — no VPN required.

**Working:**
- Log in with your FlexRadio SmartSDR+ account (email/password)
- Radio auto-discovered via SmartLink server
- Full TCP command channel: tune, change modes, adjust filters, all controls work
- Unified radio list shows both local (LAN) and remote (SmartLink) radios
- Stable TLS connection with automatic keepalive

**Needs Testing (call for testers!):**
- UDP streaming (FFT spectrum, waterfall, audio) over WAN
- We confirmed TCP works but UDP packets aren't arriving through carrier NAT (T-Mobile)
- **We need testers with home WiFi remote access** (not mobile hotspot) to verify UDP works with proper port forwarding
- Port forwarding required: TCP 4994 + UDP 4993 to radio's LAN IP

### How to Test SmartLink

1. **At home:** Enable SmartLink in SmartSDR → Settings → SmartLink Setup
2. **Forward ports:** TCP 4994 and UDP 4993 to your radio's LAN IP
3. **Test ports:** Click "Test" in SmartSDR's SmartLink Setup — both should be green
4. **Remote:** Build AetherSDR on a remote machine, log in with your FlexRadio account
5. **Report:** Share results in [Discussions](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/discussions) — especially if FFT/waterfall/audio works!

### Requirements
- SmartSDR+ subscription (for SmartLink access)
- Port forwarding on home router (TCP 4994, UDP 4993)
- FlexRadio with SmartLink enabled and registered

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-03-17


### Profile Management
Full profile management matching SmartSDR's Profiles menu:

**Profiles menu** (menu bar):
- Dynamic list of global profiles loaded from radio
- Active profile marked with checkmark
- Click to instantly load a global profile

**Profile Manager dialog** (Profiles → Profile Manager...):
- **Global tab**: Load, Save, Delete global profiles with name entry field
- **Transmit tab**: Manage TX profiles
- **Microphone tab**: Manage mic profiles
- **Auto-Save tab**: Toggle auto-save for TX/mic profile changes
- Lists refresh in real-time as the radio processes changes
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Double-click to load

### Critical Bug Fixes

**Profile load crash (SEGV)**: Loading a global profile that changes the slice caused a segfault in `AppletPanel::setSlice()` — the old SliceModel was deleted but its pointer wasn't cleared before disconnect. Fixed by nulling all slice pointers in `onSliceRemoved` before re-wiring.

**No audio after profile load**: After loading a profile, the radio destroys and recreates the slice, invalidating the old `remote_audio_rx` stream. The radio rejected duplicate stream creation with `5000008e`. Fixed by removing the old stream before creating a new one, chained via callback.

**No FFT after profile load**: The `m_panResized` flag wasn't reset when a slice was removed, preventing the panadapter from re-syncing with the radio's new display settings.

- Fill slider (0-100) + color picker — FFT gradient fill opacity and color
- Weighted Average toggle

**Waterfall controls:**
- Gain slider (0-100) — waterfall color intensity/contrast
- Black slider (0-125) + Auto — waterfall black level threshold
- Rate slider (25-500ms) — waterfall scroll speed

All controls send `display pan set` / `display panafall set` commands to the radio and update the local display simultaneously.

### XML Settings System
Migrated all client-side settings from Qt's QSettings INI format to an XML file at `~/.config/AetherSDR/AetherSDR.settings`:
- SSDR-compatible key names (PascalCase, True/False booleans)
- Auto-migration from old QSettings on first launch
- Per-station settings support
- Human-readable, hand-editable XML

### Settings Menu Dialogs
- **Network Diagnostics** — RTT, max RTT, RX/TX rates, packet drop stats
- **Memory Channels** — create/select/remove radio-side memory channels
- **Spot Settings** — spot display preferences (levels, font size, colors)

### Other Improvements
- Unified combo box styling via shared `ComboStyle.h` — all dropdowns now have consistent dark-themed appearance with painted down-arrow
- Auto-connect fix: disconnect now clears saved radio serial, preventing unwanted reconnect on app restart
- Updated STYLEGUIDE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md

## [v0.2.4] — 2026-03-16


### Bug Fix: Band Memory Deprecated
Per-band settings persistence has been temporarily disabled pending a full redesign (#9). The automatic band-crossing detection was incorrectly saving state during connection, causing 80m/40m band buttons to tune to 20m instead (#8). 

Band switching still works — clicking a band button tunes to the correct default frequency and mode. Per-band memory (remembering antenna, zoom, filter settings per band) will return in a future release with a more robust design.

### TX Settings Tab
New TX tab in the Radio Setup dialog:
- ACC TX, RCA TX1/TX2/TX3 timing delays
- TX Profile dropdown (populated from radio)
- RCA/Accessory interlock polarity settings
- Max Power limit (editable, 0-100%)
- Tune Mode selector (Single Tone / Two Tone)
- Show TX in Waterfall toggle

## [v0.2.3] — 2026-03-16


### Bug Fix
- **Band menu tuning to wrong frequency** — Clicking 80m or 40m would sometimes tune to 20m instead. The band-crossing detection was incorrectly saving state during initial connection. Fixed by guarding with `m_updatingFromModel` flag. Stale band memory is automatically cleared on first launch of v0.2.3. (#8)

### Settings Dialog
- **Settings menu** added between File and View (Radio Setup, Network, FlexControl, multiFLEX, etc.)
- **Radio Setup** — Radio tab with serial number, callsign, nickname (editable), region, HW version, options, Remote On/multiFLEX toggles
- **Network tab** — IP address, subnet mask, MAC address, DHCP/Static IP configuration with Apply button, Enforce Private IP toggle
- **GPS tab** — Installed status, latitude/longitude, grid square, altitude, satellite tracked/visible, speed, freq error, UTC time

### Other
- macOS build support (Homebrew portaudio link path fix)
- Desktop integration (.desktop file + cmake install rules)
- System UTC clock fallback when no GPS installed
- DAX/Hamlib added to roadmap (#7)

## [v0.2.2] — 2026-03-16


### Bug Fix: Multi-Client (Multi-Flex) Support

AetherSDR now operates correctly when another client (SmartSDR, Maestro) is already connected to the radio. Previously, connecting AetherSDR as a second client would cause:

- Waterfall displaying all red (processing the other client's FFT data)
- Zoom/scale changes replicating between clients
- Both clients tuning in sync (sharing the same slice)

**Fix:** Three-layer filtering by `client_handle`:
1. **Slice ownership** — only tracks slices belonging to our client
2. **Display status** — only processes our panadapter/waterfall status updates
3. **VITA-49 packets** — only decodes FFT/waterfall data from our stream IDs

AetherSDR now creates its own independent slice and panadapter when connecting to a radio with existing clients, enabling true Multi-Flex operation.
