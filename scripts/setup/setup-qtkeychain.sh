# setup-qtkeychain.sh — Build qtkeychain for Linux and macOS release packaging.
#
# Downloads the qtkeychain source, builds it from source against the Qt6
# installation in use (aqt-provided or system), and installs it into
# third_party/qtkeychain/ ready for CMake find_package(Qt6Keychain).
#
# Required for SmartLink credential persistence (saves the Auth0 refresh
# token in the system credential store so users are not prompted on every
# launch). The Linux AppImage previously shipped without it, so persistence
# silently compiled out (#3639).
#
# Building from source — rather than apt-installing qtkeychain-qt6-dev —
# guarantees the library matches the exact Qt the AppImage links (aqt Qt
# 6.12.0 on x86_64), avoiding an ABI mismatch with the distro's Qt.
#
# LIBSECRET_SUPPORT is OFF on purpose: that selects qtkeychain's pure
# Qt-D-Bus Secret Service backend, which talks to KDE Wallet (kwalletd) and
# GNOME Keyring over the session bus with no extra native runtime deps to
# bundle — only Qt6 D-Bus, which linuxdeploy already carries. It has no effect
# on macOS, where qtkeychain always uses the native Keychain backend.
#
# Requires: cmake, ninja, a C++ compiler, git, and a discoverable Qt6.
#
# MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET (optional, macOS only) must be set to the SAME value
# the app is built with. CMake otherwise leaves CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
# empty and clang stamps the *runner's* OS into LC_BUILD_VERSION — a dylib with
# minos 15.0 inside a bundle that advertises 14.0, which dyld refuses to load on
# macOS 14. The library is copied into Contents/Frameworks (CMakeLists.txt,
# APPLE branch of the Qt6Keychain block), so it ships with that stamp. The flag
# is built into QTKEYCHAIN_OSX_TARGET below and passed only on Darwin with the
# variable set, so Linux is left exactly as it was.
#
# Usage: ./setup-qtkeychain.sh

# ── Build + install ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# On macOS the deployment target has to be passed through, not left to default.
# Without it clang targets the BUILD HOST, so a macos-15 runner produces a dylib
# with LC_BUILD_VERSION minos 15.0 — and since CMakeLists.txt copies
# libqt6keychain.1.dylib into Contents/Frameworks, dyld then refuses to load it
# on anything older and the app dies at launch rather than degrading. The bundle
# floor is the MAX minos across everything staged, so one unpinned dependency
# silently overrides the deployment target of the whole DMG. Same reasoning as
# scripts/setup/setup-macos-deps.sh; asserted after macdeployqt by
# scripts/build/assert-macos-bundle.sh.
# Warn rather than fail when it is unset: a developer building locally wants the
# host default and has no bundle to break. The release path always sets it, and
# assert-macos-bundle.sh fails the DMG if it ever stops doing so — so the check
# that matters is downstream, and this stays usable off CI.
#
# Expand it as ${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"} below, never plain "${arr[@]}": macOS ships
# bash 3.2, where expanding an EMPTY array under `set -u` is an unbound-variable
# error. That is the same trap that killed setup-macos-deps.sh four seconds into
# the DMG build, and the empty case here is the branch this comment is about —
# the local developer who has not set the variable would get the crash instead
# of the warning.
