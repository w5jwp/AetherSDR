# setup-qt.sh — Install the exact Qt AetherSDR releases are built with, for a
# source build on Linux or macOS.
#
# AetherSDR requires Qt 6.12 (QT_SOURCE_FLOOR in cmake/qt-pin.env), the Qt
# every release is built against, and few distros package it yet. This is the
# supported way to get it for a source build; a distro or Qt-installer Qt that
# is already 6.12+ works too.
#
# It installs the pinned version from cmake/qt-pin.env — the same file that
# every CI leg and release workflow is checked against — with the same pinned
# aqtinstall, into a per-user cache shared by every checkout:
#
#   Linux:  ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/aethersdr/qt/
#   macOS:  ~/Library/Caches/aethersdr/qt/
#
# (override with AETHER_QT_CACHE). Each install is an immutable generation,
# gen/<version>-<revision>-<id>/, and <version>-<revision>.current names the
# live one. A reinstall builds a new generation beside the old and publishes it
# by atomically replacing that pointer file, so every checkout sees either the
# old kit or the new one and never neither (Constitution XIV). Superseded
# generations are kept: binaries already built in any checkout link their Qt by
# absolute path and must keep launching until they are rebuilt, so nothing is
# deleted until you ask with --prune. No tree is ever renamed,
# so the paths aqt patches into the kit (qmake, CMake, .pc files) stay true.
# CMake reads the pointer on its own
# (cmake/AetherQtPin.cmake), so after this script a plain `cmake -B build`
# picks the pinned Qt up with no flags.
#
# Then it builds qtkeychain against that Qt (setup-qtkeychain.sh). A
# qtkeychain built against a different Qt is an ABI mismatch, and leaving it
# out silently compiles SmartLink credential persistence away (#3639).
#
# The checks run BEFORE the 2 GB download, so an unsupported machine is told
# what is wrong and what to do instead, rather than discovering it as a loader
# error after the fact:
#   - glibc new enough for Qt's Linux binaries (QT_MIN_GLIBC_* in the pin file)
#   - Xcode new enough for Qt's macOS SDK check (QT_MIN_XCODE)
#   - a working `python3 -m venv` (Debian/Ubuntu split it into python3-venv)
#   - free disk space
#   - the repository still serving the pinned package revision
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/setup/setup-qt.sh                 install (no-op if already present)
#   scripts/setup/setup-qt.sh --print-prefix  print the Qt prefix CMake will use
#   scripts/setup/setup-qt.sh --no-keychain   skip the qtkeychain build
#   scripts/setup/setup-qt.sh --prune         delete every generation but the
#                                             live one (frees ~2 GB each; builds
#                                             against a pruned one must rebuild)
#
# Requires: python3, curl, and for qtkeychain: git, cmake, ninja, a C++
# compiler. Windows builders: see docs/BUILDING.md (Qt online installer or aqt).
