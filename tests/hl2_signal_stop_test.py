"""A killed AetherSDR must still release the Hermes-Lite 2.

An HL2 that is never told to stop keeps streaming at a host that is gone and
then stops answering discovery until it is physically power-cycled. Qt tears
nothing down on a signal, so Hl2Backend's destructor -- which does send the stop
-- never runs.

This stands in as the fake radio: bind a UDP socket, run a real MetisClient
against it, kill that process, and require a metis-stop datagram to arrive.

Deliberately an end-to-end process test rather than a unit test. Calling
fireEmergencyStop() directly would prove sendto() works; it would not prove the
handler is installed, that MetisClient armed it, or that the descriptor is still
usable at the moment the process dies -- which are the three things that can
actually be wrong.
