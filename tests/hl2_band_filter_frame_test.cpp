// WHAT AN EP2 FRAME IS ALLOWED TO CARRY. Two properties of the same packet
// builder, kept in one target because they are asserted on the same bytes:
//
//   sections 1-4  a band change must not put a stale sample rate in the later
//                 of an EP2 frame's two C&C banks (aethersdr/AetherSDR#4579);
//   section 5     the frame's audio slot stays untouched unless a codec has
//                 been DECLARED, because on a bare HL2 that slot is the
//                 extended address register;
//   section 6     a live-control setter called while STOPPED queues nothing,
//                 so the first frames of the next session are its own
//                 start-up state and not a bank left over from before it
//                 (the remainder of #4579).
//
// SOCKET-FREE ON PURPOSE. It drives MetisClient's own packet builder, which is
// public for exactly this reason ("Exists so the gate can be tested on the exact
// bytes that would go out"), rather than standing up a fake radio -- the
// fake-radio fixtures for this path are retired, and are kept in tests.cmake
// only as a bracket comment.
//
// WHAT IS UNDER TEST. buildNextControlPacket() puts LIVE m_ccConfig in bank A of
// every frame; a one-shot only ever fills bank B; and the radio applies bank B
// after bank A. So a COPY of m_ccConfig queued as a one-shot is both redundant
// -- bank A already carried the change -- and, because it is a snapshot, able to
// overwrite the live value for one frame when something else rebuilds the config
// register in between.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT TEST. That the radio really applies the second sub-frame last
// is a protocol fact read from the HPSDR frame layout, not something measured
// here: no radio is involved and nothing is keyed. The assertions below do not
// depend on it -- they require that no frame carry two config banks at all, so
// there is no second one to win or lose.
