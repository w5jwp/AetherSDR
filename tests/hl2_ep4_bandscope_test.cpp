// HL2 wideband bandscope (endpoint 0x04) — parser unit test. Pure protocol:
// no sockets, no Qt, no hardware, compiling MetisProtocol.cpp directly the way
// hl2_metis_protocol_test does.
//
// What is under test is the decode of a stream that is NOT IQ: 512 raw 12-bit
// AD9866 codes per datagram, little-endian and shifted left by four, carried on
// the same socket as EP6 behind a 20-bit sequence counter of its own.
//
// TWO OF THESE CASES EXIST BECAUSE OF A BENCH RUN, not because of the protocol
// document, and they are the ones that would fail a parser written from the
// gateware reading alone:
//
//   * a fresh stream emits 0, 1, 2 and then RESTARTS AT 0 — usopenhpsdr1.v
//     forces `ep4_seq_no`'s low two bits to zero while the capture FIFO is not
//     yet full. Measured three times in six legs, always in the first tens of
//     milliseconds. A 32-bit-style gap detector reads that `2 -> 0` as a
//     forward gap of 1,048,574 and reports a million lost packets in the first
//     second of every session;
//   * a genuine forward skip must still count, so the guard cannot simply
//     ignore every discontinuity.
//
// Sequence-number expectations are grounded in the recorded arrivals of that
// run (see tests/Hl2Ep4ArrivalsD94.h), so what is asserted here is what a real
// radio actually sent rather than what a fixture author imagined it would.
