//
// setReceiverCount() stops the EP6 stream, rebuilds the payload layout and starts
// it again. That start is a single UDP datagram and is exactly as losable as the
// one at connect, so it needs the same retry. Without it, one dropped packet left
// the radio silent with nothing re-asking it to stream: kSilenceTimeoutMs later
// the EP6 watchdog reported link loss and the operator's session died — from
// having clicked "Add Panadapter".
//
// The fake radio here models a radio that IGNORES one start and honours the next,
// which is what a dropped datagram looks like from the host side. It also GATES
// EP6 on its own start/stop state: the whole assertion is that samples stop and
// then come back, so a fixture that streamed regardless would pass with or
// without the retry and prove nothing.
//
// The second half is the reason this is not just a timer test. A restart must not
// look like a reconnect — Hl2Backend republishes its entire initial state on
// linkUp, over the operator's live panes — so linkUp must fire exactly once
// across the whole run and linkDown not at all.
