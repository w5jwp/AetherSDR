// HL2 wideband bandscope (endpoint 0x04) — MetisClient ingest. Socket-free:
// no bind, no peer, no radio. Recorded datagrams are handed straight to the
// drain path through MetisClientTestAccess, the friend seam MetisClient.h
// already declares for exactly this.
//
// The claim under test is not "EP4 parses" — hl2_ep4_bandscope_test owns that.
// It is that EP4 and EP6 are accounted SEPARATELY on one socket:
//
//   * a bandscope datagram must increment ep4Packets and NOT rxPackets, and it
//     must not touch the EP6 drop counter or the silence watchdog's clock;
//   * ep4_seq_no is a different counter with a different reset, so a client
//     sharing EP6's expectation would report a gap on nearly every packet;
//   * the counter's start-of-stream rewind is a RESET, not a loss, and it is
//     counted where it can be seen rather than folded into ep4Drops.
//
// Section 8 carries the same claim one layer up, at the IRadioBackend seam:
// the rows a health dialog reads, and the verb that is the only way to ask for
// the stream.
//
// The sequences replayed here are recorded arrivals from a real v74.2 board
// (tests/Hl2Ep4ArrivalsD94.h), not invented ones.
