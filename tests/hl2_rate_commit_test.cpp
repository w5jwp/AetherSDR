// Hl2RateCommit — the ordering rule a pan-bandwidth change depends on.
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS AND WHAT IT CANNOT COVER. The end-to-end seam here is
// Hl2Backend::applyPanBandwidth() driving three threads, and exercising that
// needs a MetisClient and a localhost peer, which the default graph excludes.
//
// So what is pinned here is the rule that was actually broken: a crossing that
// has not written the register has not changed the rate, no matter what the
// backend's optimistic m_sampleRateHz says in the meantime. Hl2Backend holds one
// RateCommitLedger and reads it for both decisions that got this wrong, so
// pinning the ledger pins the rule at its single source.
