// Pan pixel-dimension routing — the channels out of
// MainWindow::sendPanDimensionsToRadio(), pinned socket-free.
//
// #5920 gave the ANAN panadapter one analyzer point per screen pixel by adding
// a typed seam verb (IRadioBackend::setPanPixelWidth, routed by
// RadioModel::requestLocalPanPixelWidth) beside the Flex `xpixels=` wire text
// that call site had always sent. Its review (@jensenpat, non-blocking) asked
// for exactly this: "a socket-free routing test could pin Flex wire delivery,
// ANAN typed dispatch, and Icom's no-command path at the shared GUI/model
// seam."
//
// The same review also had to CORRECT the PR's own account of the Icom path:
// `shapesDisplayRatesLocally()` covers every non-Flex backend, so Icom ACCEPTS
// the typed call and eats it in the default no-op. It does not decline the seam
// and get stopped by the `hasCommandPlane()` guard, which is what the PR
// discussion said twice. Nothing in the build noticed the wrong story; that is
// the gap this file closes.
//
// WHY THIS FILE HAS TWO HALVES, AND WHY THE COMPOSITION IS A PROOF.
//
// The decision lives in a MainWindow method, and no test target in this repo
// constructs a MainWindow. It cannot move down into RadioModel either: the
// fallback is raw Flex wire text, and tools/check_command_plane.py is a
// PER-FILE, SHRINK-ONLY ratchet with src/models/RadioModel.cpp frozen at its
// baseline count — relocating one `sendCommand()` there fails the ratchet. That
// is what RadioModel::requestLocalPanWeightedAverage's own comment means by
// "moving it in here would add a raw command above the seam". So the call site
// stays where it is and this file pins it from both sides:
//
//   PART A (behaviour; real backends built through the production family
//   switch; no socket, no device, no radio) — what the two predicates in that
//   condition actually answer, per family. This is the half that would have
//   caught the Icom mis-description.
//
//   PART B (the call site, read as TEXT) — that the condition is exactly those
//   two predicates, in that order, with those arguments, guarding exactly that
//   wire spelling.
//
// Neither half alone is worth much: A without B describes predicates nobody
// promises the call site consults, and B without A is a spelling checker. What
// makes the pair a proof is the ORDER claim, which is load-bearing and not
// obvious from either side alone:
//
//   ANAN has NO command plane (Part A measures this). A reviewer tidying the
//   condition into `hasCommandPlane() && !requestLocalPanPixelWidth(...)` —
//   which reads identically and satisfies every stated requirement of #4448 —
//   short-circuits before the seam call, and the ANAN width silently stops
//   reaching the analyzer. The panadapter goes soft again with nothing red.
//   Part A supplies "ANAN has no plane", Part B supplies "the seam is
//   evaluated first", and together they close that.
//
// AND THE OTHER HALF OF THAT CONDITION, which review asked about. For every
// family whose seam ACCEPTS, `&&` short-circuits and `hasCommandPlane()` is
// never evaluated — so Icom's wire text is stopped one term EARLIER than it
// looks, and no family row can falsify the guard. For Flex and the demo the
// plane is always there, since FlexBackend news its RadioConnection in its
// constructor. The one state where the guard is the only thing between a model
// and a send is NO BACKEND AT ALL, and that is the last row of Part A.
// Without it Part B would pin a term in place that Part A never shows doing any
// work — the inverse of the composition this header argues for.
//
// Part B is a brace matcher and a regular expression, not a compiler, so the
// analyser is a pure function run first against SYNTHETIC sources. Those runs
// are the POSITIVE CONTROLS: they prove it can reject each mutation rather than
// reporting health because it never matches anything. Same spirit, and the same
// stated limitation, as wdsp_nb_hold_invariant_test and meter_surfaces_test.
//
// MUTATION RUNS BEHIND PART A. Part B's controls are in this file and run on
// every invocation; Part A's assertions were earned against real production
// source, each one edited on its own and rebuilt:
//
//   * the call site's two halves swapped -> the seam-first check (this is the
//     bug the two halves exist to catch, and it needs no rebuild at all: the
//     text check reads MainWindow_Wiring.cpp at run time);
//   * requestLocalPanPixelWidth narrowed to `m_family == "anan"`, which is the
//     story the #5920 discussion told twice -> the HL2 and Icom rows;
//   * hasCommandPlane() forced true -> the three no-plane rows AND the
//     no-backend row, which is what earns the guard term;
//   * shapesDisplayRatesLocally() widened to include Flex -> the Flex row;
//   * backendPanIdFor() dropped from the seam call -> the pan-id row;
//   * the isEmpty() guard dropped -> the empty-pan-id row;
//   * the seam accepting the width and forwarding nothing -> the point-count
//     and pan-id rows.
//
// Three checks are CONTROLS rather than claims and are labelled as such below:
// that every family built, that the fixture's two pan ids actually differ, and
// that the source file opened. None of them can fail for an interesting reason;
// they exist so that a vacuous run cannot read as a healthy one.
//
// WHAT IS NOT GUARDED HERE, left bare rather than half-guarded: the local
// decoder rescale and the DSS scale-settle gate that surround the block (their
// own tests own those), whether a given point count LOOKS right on a G2 (a
// measurement, not a predicate), and the values panXpixelsFor() and
// panLocalSpectrumPointsFor() compute from a widget — spectrum_preview_logic_test
// owns the crop arithmetic. This file pins WHICH channel each family uses and
// WHICH of those two functions feeds each channel.
