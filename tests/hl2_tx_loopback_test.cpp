// End-to-end transmit proof against hpsdrsim.
//
// hpsdrsim models the PureSignal feedback path: while PTT is asserted it feeds
// the TX IQ it received BACK into the RX stream, scaled by TX drive and with
// simulated IM3. So if we key, set a drive level and transmit a tone, that tone
// must reappear in our own spectrum at the offset we transmitted it on.
//
// That closes the loop the unit tests cannot: hl2_tx_gate_test proves the right
// BYTES leave, but only the simulator can show the radio actually received them
// and acted on them.
//
// SIM ONLY, deliberately — and now ENFORCED rather than asserted. This test keys
// the transmitter, so pointing it at real hardware would radiate. It used to
// trust a hardcoded LAN address to BE the simulator; findSimulator() below
// checks the responder's identity instead, and the default host is loopback.
// If nothing answers, the test SKIPS rather than fails, so a machine without the
// simulator running does not get a spurious red — exiting 77, which the
// SKIP_RETURN_CODE on its add_test turns into an honest ctest "Skipped" rather
// than a "Passed" that measured nothing.
//
// WHICH SIDE OF CENTRE A TONE LANDS ON. The loop flips handedness TWICE. The
// transmit side puts IQ on the wire in wire order, the opposite handedness to
// the analytic convention (the tone generator conjugates; the default TXA
// modulator gets there through its signed passband); the simulator feeds that IQ
// back verbatim; Hl2RxDsp conjugates it before the panadapter FFT. The two
// flips cancel, so the spectrum this test reads is in the ANALYTIC convention:
// a tone transmitted 5 kHz above the carrier appears 5 kHz ABOVE centre.
//
// It did not always. The receive-side conjugation arrived in #4471, to fix a
// panadapter that drew every signal mirrored — on 40 m it put FT8 below a
// correctly-drawn DIGU cursor. Before that the display carried the raw wire and
// the fed-back tone read BELOW centre. This test was written against that older
// display in #4466 and went on asserting the negative offset afterwards. That
// staleness — not transmit — is the whole of the "fails on transmit-sideband
// checks" that docs/HERMES.md carried as pre-existing.
//
// BUT cancelling conjugations mean this loopback ALONE cannot prove absolute
// sideband: a handedness error at BOTH ends still cancels. That is exactly how a
// wrong-sideband transmitter once passed its own tests, and it took an operator
// with a second receiver to catch it. So before believing anything the
// transmitter puts in the spectrum, we pin the RECEIVE end against a signal that
// never went through the transmitter — the simulator's own synthetic scene. See
// the scene anchor below.
