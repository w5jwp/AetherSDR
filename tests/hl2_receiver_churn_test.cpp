// HL2 — add and close receivers WHILE EP6 IS FLOWING.
//
// This is the one test in the suite where the operator's "Add Panadapter" and
// pane-close run against a live stream, and that combination is the whole point.
//
// m_rx is RESHAPED on this thread by createPanadapter()/removePanadapter(): a
// push_back reallocates and an erase shifts. The EP6 fan-out used to iterate that
// same vector on the I/O thread, dereferencing m_rx[i].dsp for every arriving
// packet, so either reshape could pull the storage out from under it. The fan-out
// now works from its own list — see Hl2Backend::publishIoDsps() — and this test
// exercises the window where the two used to collide.
//
// A pass here does NOT prove the separation on its own: a use-after-free on a
// four-element vector usually reads memory the allocator has handed straight back,
// and nothing visible happens. What this test does is put the contended window on
// the wire so a sanitizer can see it — under -fsanitize=thread, the old fan-out
// reports the receiver vector as raced from here and the current one does not.
//
// Read that as a DIFFERENTIAL, never as a count: QtCore ships uninstrumented, so
// every Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection in the backend reports as a race whatever the
// receiver set is doing.
// HERMES §20.15.1 has the full account.
//
// Under a plain build, treat the checks below as what they are — churn does not
// corrupt the receiver set or lose a receiver's signals.
//
// The fake radio is UNCAPPED: EP6 has to still be
// arriving at the instant the vector is reshaped, or there is no window to test.
