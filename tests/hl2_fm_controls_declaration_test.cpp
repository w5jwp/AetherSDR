// The FM repeater and tone controls the Hermes-Lite 2 does NOT have.
//
// Two fields decide whether those controls are live, and on this radio both
// answered wrongly in different ways:
//
//   * hasFmRepeaterOffset was never declared, so it INHERITED the struct's
//     permissive default (true) and the offset spin, the ±steps and the simplex
//     button came up enabled. IRadioBackend::setSliceRepeaterOffsetDir and
//     setSliceFmRepeaterOffset are virtuals with empty bodies and Hl2Backend
//     overrides neither, so those controls moved a number that reached nothing.
//
//   * fmTonePresentation WAS declared, as Legacy — the capability map's row was
//     wrong about this half. Legacy is the value that fills the tone-mode combo
//     from legacyFmToneModes(), i.e. it offers CTCSS ENCODE, on a backend that
//     has no CTCSS encoder anywhere and cannot key an FM carrier at all.
//
// THE ARGUMENT RESTS ON receiveOnlyModes, NOT ON THE MODULATOR, and that is a
// deliberate choice this target enforces. The HL2's transmit modulator is
// selected at BUILD time by AETHER_HL2_TX_TXA (default ON = a WDSP TXA channel,
// whose chain does carry fmmod; OFF = the in-tree phasing SSB modulator), so
// any assertion phrased about the modulator would be half wrong in every build.
// What holds in both is that FM and NFM are declared receive-only, which is
// what RadioModel::refuseKeyInReceiveOnlyMode() reads.
//
// WHY THESE TWO AND NOT FM ITSELF. Nothing here says the HL2 cannot RECEIVE FM;
// it can, and this test asserts that it still declares FM receive-only rather
// than absent. What is withdrawn is a transmit-side control surface for a mode
// the backend already refuses to key in.
//
// SOCKET-FREE. Constructs a backend and reads capabilities(); binds nothing,
// connects nothing, pumps no event loop, and reaches no radio. It does read one
// production SOURCE file, through AETHER_SOURCE_DIR — see limitation 1 below
// for why, and rf_gain_presentation_test for the same shape already in use.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT OBSERVE, said plainly because a declaration test that
// overstates its reach is worse than none:
//
//   1. fmTonePresentation's struct DEFAULT is already Hidden, so the assertion
//      that the HL2 REPORTS Hidden passes just as well against a backend that
//      says nothing at all — it cannot fail on a deletion, only on a change of
//      value. That is a property of the source TEXT, so the source text is
//      what the second tone assertion below reads, the way
//      rf_gain_presentation_test reads its production wiring — as a
//      whitespace-tolerant pattern rather than a literal substring, so a
//      reformat cannot turn it red while the declaration stands. What THAT in
//      turn cannot see is whether the statement it finds is the last one to
//      run: a second assignment further down would beat it unnoticed. The two
//      lines together are what the value assertion alone was claiming.
//      hasFmRepeaterOffset never had this problem — its default is the
//      OPPOSITE value, so deleting its line fails the value assertion
//      directly, and that is why the two facts are asserted separately.
//   2. That the two widgets actually honour these fields. VfoWidget::
//      configureFmToneControls and RxApplet::configureFmToneControls read them
//      directly — a coupling a reader can see in four lines — but reaching it
//      needs a constructed widget, and no test in this tree builds one of
//      these. Nothing here was measured on a radio either.
