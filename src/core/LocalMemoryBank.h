// works unchanged. It answers the four commands (`memory create`, `memory set
// <idx> <kv...>`, `memory remove <idx>`, `memory apply <idx>`) locally in the
// same shape, decoded with MemoryWire::decodeStatus. One-way ownership: the bank
// returns a MemoryDelta; RadioModel applies it (0x7f -> ' ' decode,
// sanitisation, memoryChanged/memoryRemoved) and calls record() with the decoded
// MemoryEntry, which is persisted, so the JSON matches what the UI and CSV see.
