// has already applied tone, compressor, EQ), baseband IQ out for EP2. 24 kHz
// in, fixed 48 kHz out; WDSP's three-rate channel interpolates.
//
// The modulator is chosen only at build time by AETHER_HL2_TX_TXA (no runtime
// switch): 1 (default) = WDSP TXA channel; 0 = in-tree phasing modulator, not
// built by any CI job (see CMakeLists.txt). The level chain (mic gain, ALC,
// clamp, meters) is shared by both.
//
// Handedness differs between them:
//   * Phasing emits the standard analytic signal and must be CONJUGATED for
//     the HPSDR wire, or every signal goes out on the wrong sideband.
//   * TXA must NOT be conjugated: fir_bandpass builds exp(-j*w_osc*pos), so it
//     already has the wire's handedness. The passband SIGN carries the
//     sideband, since TXASetupBPFilters treats TXA_LSB and TXA_USB identically.
// Config::filterLowHz/filterHighHz stay positive audio-domain magnitudes; the
// TXA build applies the sign in applyModeAndFilter(). Keep it there: Hl2Backend's
// table feeds the readback and stored eSSB pair, which want magnitudes.
// The TXA build depends on caller cadence; see processAudioBlock.
