    // SETTLES. Quiescent it moved 0.307 dB in 74 s and 0.0000 dB/s over the
    // second half; stepped 12 dB of LNA it moved 5.99 dB, re-settled within
    // ~30 s and went flat again. With the flag declared false the reference
    // level sat pinned at -40.000 dBm for 222 s while the measured floor moved
    // 2 dB. So the declaration would remove a loop that demonstrably works.

    //
    // The second reading is why the omissions bit harder than a missing menu

    // requested -- including a mode that is on the list. It cannot be steered

    // ModelReceiveControlTarget::available is an any-slice OR over checkSlice,
    // so with one healthy slice present slice.setMode still advertises as
    // available while being refused for the stranded one. That is worse than a
    // clean retraction, not better.)
    //
    // DSB and CWL are modes this backend genuinely demodulates --
    // modeFromString() maps each onto its own WdspChannel::Mode (Dsb, Cwl) and
    // defaultPassbandForMode() carries an entry written for each ({-3000,3000}
    // and {-250,250}) -- and both are on publishedModeStrings(), so the mode
    // MENU offers them. An operator could pick DSB out of the combo and strand
    // the slice.
    //
    // NO ALIAS SPELLING IS ON THIS LIST, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN
    // TIDINESS. An earlier revision of this change added "CWU" here, reasoning
    // that setSliceMode() could put that spelling on a slice and the observed
    // read would then strand it. The right fix was the other one: setSliceMode()
    // below now runs canonicalOfferedMode(), so "CWU" collapses onto "CW"
    // BEFORE a slice holds it, and applyRestoredState() has always done the
    // same. With both closed, every writer of Receiver::mode produces a
    // canonical spelling and no slice can be OBSERVED in an alias at all.
    //
    // AND AN ALIAS LEFT ON THE LIST WOULD THEN LATCH THE SLICE, which is the
    // fault this whole declaration exists to remove, arriving by the other
    // door. ModelReceiveControlTarget::setMode records the REQUESTED string
    // (`m_pendingModes.insert(slice, mode)`) and releases it only on an
    // observation that compares EQUAL to it. Ask for "CWU", get "CW"
    // published, and that entry never clears -- after which checkSlice()
    // refuses every further Mode AND Filter intent on the slice with
    // "request.conflict" until the radio disconnects or the backend is
    // rebuilt. So an alias on this list is not a harmless extra entry once the
    // backend canonicalises; it is a permanent wedge.
    //
    // THE INVARIANT THAT KEEPS IT SHUT, asserted in control_receive_test
    // rather than left here: every mode on this list is its own canonical
    // spelling -- canonicalOfferedMode(m) == m for all of them. That is
    // exactly the condition under which the requested string and the published
    // one cannot disagree.
    //
    // It also happens to make this list equal to publishedModeStrings(), which
    // is the right shape for a different reason given below, and the two are
    // still separate questions: this one asks "may the receive control plane
    // be asked for it", the menu asks "should an operator be able to pick it".
    //
    // DSB BEING ON receiveOnlyModes IS NOT A CONTRADICTION: that list answers
    // "may this radio KEY in this mode", this one answers "may the receive
    // control plane be asked for it". A receive-only mode is precisely a mode a
    // receiver may sit in.
    //
    // THE TEST APPLIED HERE is "does this backend SERVE the mode", not "does
    // modeFromString() have a line for it". DSB and CWL pass it on the same
    // terms as the seven already listed: a WdspChannel::Mode of their own, a
    // defaultPassbandForMode() entry written for them, and nothing about the
    // chain left at a value nobody chose. CWU passes on a narrower ground and
    // it is worth being exact about it -- it is CW's second spelling, sharing
    // both the WDSP mode and the passband entry, and it earns a place here only
    // because the run-time paths above can put that spelling on a slice.
    //
    // FM IS DECLARED, AND ON A DIFFERENT GROUND FROM THE OTHERS.
    // It does NOT pass the "does this backend serve the mode" test above --
    // the demodulator reservations below are all still true -- and it is
    // here anyway, because this list's SECOND reading makes exclusion the
    // more dangerous answer. publishedModeStrings() carries "FM", so
    // SliceDelta::modeList publishes it and the mode MENU offers it. The set
    // difference between the menu and this list was exactly {FM}: pick FM out
    // of the combo and the slice is stranded, in the same self-latching way
    // DSB and CWL were, with no way back out over the control plane.
    //
    // A mode the radio's own menu puts on a slice must not latch the control
    // plane shut. That is the ground: not "the HL2 serves FM well", but "the
    // HL2 already lets an operator sit in FM, so the receive control plane
    // must be able to steer them out of it".
    //
    // "NFM" IS NOT LISTED, and deliberately so. It is FM's alias, it is not on
    // publishedModeStrings(), and setSliceMode() below collapses it onto "FM"
    // before a slice holds it -- so there is no observation to rescue, and
    // listing it would create the permanent "request.conflict" wedge described
    // in the alias paragraph above. receiveOnlyModes is the list that still
    // needs both spellings, and for its own reason: that one is a membership
    // test run on whatever string the slice happens to hold, and it must stay
    // correct even if a future change reopens a route this one closes.
    //
    // NOTE WHAT THIS ALSO WIDENS, because the list is read twice and this is
    // the other read: slice.setMode mode="FM" is now accepted where it was
    // refused "request.out_of_range". KEYING IS UNAFFECTED, and
    // that is checked rather than assumed -- receiveOnlyModes below carries
    // FM and NFM, RadioCapabilities::modeIsReceiveOnly() is a

    //     squelch on this backend at all (setSliceSquelch is not overridden
    //     here). "Demodulates" is true and "is served well" is not.

    // WBFM, WFM AND DRM STAY OFF, and each fails differently:

    //     hear (tuningMaxHz above is 38.4 MHz).

    // is told to build — there is no mode it receives and cannot send", and left
    // the list empty on that basis. **The transmit chain is not WDSP.**
    // Hl2TxDsp is a hand-written phasing SSB modulator: setMode() stores the
    // mode and the only reader is isLowerSideband(), which returns true for Lsb,
    // Cwl and Digl and false for everything else. So AM, SAM, DSB, FM, NFM, WBFM
    // and DRM all take the upper-sideband branch and go on the air as SSB,
    // announcing nothing.
    //
    // WHAT STAYS OFF THE LIST, deliberately:
    //
    //   * USB / LSB / DIGU / DIGL are the SSB family and modulate correctly.
    //   * CW / CWU / CWL keys a carrier the GATEWARE shapes at the TX NCO
    //     (MetisClient::setCwKeyDown). That path never reaches Hl2TxDsp, so the
    //     sideband switch above does not apply to it and CW transmits correctly.
    //
    // These strings are the neutral vocabulary SliceModel carries, and both
    // spellings of each mode appear because modeFromString() accepts both:
    // refuseKeyInReceiveOnlyMode() compares what the slice holds, not what this
    // backend would have mapped it to, so listing only one spelling would leave
    // the other keying.
    //
    // THIS DECLARATION ALSO WITHDRAWS TUNE IN THESE MODES. Say so here rather
    // than let an operator discover it.
    //
    // refuseKeyInReceiveOnlyMode() is not a MOX-and-CW guard.
    // RadioModel::beginLocalTxActivity() runs it for EVERY TxActivity, ahead of
    // the per-activity capability checks, so TxActivity::Tune is refused too —
    // and that one is a real loss, not a theoretical one. setTune() below raises
    // the carrier from the GATEWARE test-tone generator at zero offset
    // (MetisClient::setTxTestTone), a path that never reaches Hl2TxDsp, exactly
    // like the CW keyer exempted above. This radio could put a clean tune
    // carrier on the air with the TX slice in AM or FM; after this list it will
    // not, and the operator is told "Choose a transmit mode first" and has to
    // move the slice to a mode that transmits. (TxActivity::Atu was already
    // refused here for want of hasTuner, so the plain TUNE button is the only
    // behaviour this changes.)
    //
    // ACCEPTED, deliberately, on two grounds:
    //
    //   * It is what this capability already MEANS. The IC-705 declares WFM
    //     receive-only (#5040) and is refused on this same guard, with a second
    //     wire backstop in IcomCivBackend::refuseKeyingInReceiveOnlyMode() that
    //     its setTune() converges on through setKeying() — "shared by every path
    //     here that can start an emission", in its own words. HL2 is inheriting
    //     a settled contract, not inventing one.
    //   * receiveOnlyModes is ONE list of mode names with no per-activity
    //     granularity, so exempting tune is not expressible from a backend at
    //     all: it would mean changing RadioModel above the family seam, for
    //     every family at once. That is a maintainer's call.
    //
    // The CW/tune asymmetry is in the SHAPE of the list, not in the reasoning
    // behind it: CW stays off because CW is a MODE this radio transmits
    // correctly, and tune is an ACTIVITY, which a list of mode names has no
    // vocabulary for.
    //
    // What the list itself reports is only what the modulator does today. When a

    // BUILD THREAD (m_dspBuildThread): construct a COMPLETE set of N new
    // chains while the old set keeps running and keeps producing audio.
    // Nothing live is touched. N, not one, because the DDC rate register is
    // RADIO-WIDE — that is the one way this differs from AnanBackend, which
    // has a single DDC and therefore a single chain to rebuild.
    //
    // I/O THREAD (m_ioThread, reached through m_metis): if all N built, swap
    // them in and write the rate register, in one turn. The swap is pointer
    // writes.
    //
    // WHY NOT THE I/O THREAD FOR THE BUILD, which is where the previous commit
    // left it. That thread is not one receiver's — it is the wire's AND every
    // receiver's. MetisClient paces EP2 from a 2 ms timer on it and drains EP6
    // on it, and iqBlocksReady is a Qt::DirectConnection that runs
    // Hl2RxDsp::processIqBlock() inline on it. So a rebuild task holding that
    // thread starves every receiver's audio and stops EP2, and
    // docs/HERMES.md §20.8 is explicit that the gateware watchdog halts the
    // stream when EP2 stops arriving. Moving the wait off the GUI thread kept
    // the WINDOW alive during a zoom; only moving the WORK off the I/O thread
    // keeps the RADIO alive.
    //
    // WHY THERE IS NO ROLL-BACK, which the two previous notes here each said
    // was the hard part. There is nothing to roll back. Until every one of the
    // N builds has succeeded, the rate register is unwritten and no published
    // chain has been touched — so the failure path is "destroy the new set and
    // return", and the radio and every receiver are exactly as they were. The
    // roll-back was only ever needed because the old code changed live state
    // before it knew whether it could.
    //
    // WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. Nothing here is measured. The 0.6-1.1 s figure
    // is docs/HERMES.md §22.4's, from the blocking-on-the-GUI-thread era, and
    // whether the audio actually stays clean across a crossing needs a radio,

    // instrument for that.

    // #5646 removed the advice rather than misaim it, and said why in as many
    // words: WSPR, AX.25 and RADE all reached submitTxAudio() with
    // `clientLeveled` false, exactly like the microphone, so a beacon at its
    // -20 dBFS default would have drawn "raise mic gain" on every unattended
    // unkey (K5PTB, #5646 review). The seam had two states and engine audio was
    // not one of them. That branch's own comment delegated the fix here:
    // "#5647 reintroduces it gated on `!m_txAudioEngineGenerated`".
    //
    // This is that reintroduction. The gate exists now because the seam carries
    // TxAudioSource, and it is the ONLY reason the advice is safe to restore.
    // The measurement never went away — m_txMicPeakMaxDbfs kept tracking and
    // kept reaching the health snapshot throughout.
    //
    // Note the gate is narrower than #5646 anticipated: AX.25 is tagged
    // Microphone, not EngineGenerated, so the advice DOES fire for a quiet
    // packet frame. That is correct. The mic slider is the only control in the
    // product that can move an AX.25 frame (kTxAfskAmplitude is a constant and
    // the packet dialog has no level control), so "raise mic gain" is exactly
    // the right instrument there. Only the WSPR beacon has no slider in its
    // path, and only the WSPR beacon is gated off.
    //

// near -1.4 dBFS is a ~30 dB shortfall, and the old +20 dB left the chain 10.6 dB
// short at maximum slider. Widening it symmetrically would have moved unity off
// 50 and changed the transmit level of every existing install, which is the one
// thing the paragraph above forbids. So the two legs meet at 50 with different
// slopes, and hl2_tx_level_policy_test pins the join.
//
// WHAT THIS BUYS IS THE SAME ON THE TWO PATHS IT REACHES, and that is the
// change. The ALC behind this only reduces — it has no makeup half left to give
// the gain back with — so this slider is a straight proportional control on the
// air all the way up to alcTargetPeak, for the microphone (including the AX.25
// modem, whose AFSK amplitude is a fixed constant this slider is the only way to
// move) and for a TCI/DAX client alike. TX gain 5 is a real -18 dB. Past the
// target the ALC limits rather than letting the modulator's hard clamp flat-top
// the signal, so the last stretch of travel buys reduced headroom rather than
// more power.
//
// IT DOES NOT REACH TxAudioSource::EngineGenerated AUDIO AT ALL.
// Hl2TxDsp::processAudioBlock substitutes 1.0 for this multiplier on the WSPR
// pump, so a beacon goes out at the level its generator chose and this slider
// does not move it — at 0 or anywhere else. Hl2TxLevelPolicy.h carries the full
// argument; TxAudioSource.h carries which source is which.
//
// The other path-dependent thing is setKeying()'s "raise mic gain" diagnostic,
// gated off for client-leveled AND engine-generated transmissions — for the
// client because the remedy for a quiet TCI/DAX client is that client's own
// level control, and for a beacon because there is no mic slider in its path to
// raise.
//
// LEVEL 0 MUTES THE MICROPHONE AND THE TCI/DAX PATH. IT DOES NOT SILENCE THE
// TRANSMITTER. A slider at the bottom of its travel means off for the audio
// this multiplier reaches, and -20 dB is simply -20 dB on the air, so the
// special case is there because the bottom of a travel should mean off rather
// than very quiet. But engine-generated audio never reaches this multiplier:
// parking this control at 0 between voice sessions does not stop a WSPR beacon.
// Stopping an unattended transmission is the generator's own control, not this
// one.

    // display threshold would buy nothing and would leave a window in which
    // the loop refuses a block these rows still publish -- a smaller version
    // of the bug being fixed.

    // WHAT KEEPS A LIVE GATE FROM BLINKING is the producer's period against

    // "the filter for the slice frequency" was a complete answer. With four it
    // is not, because four receivers can sit on four different bands and the
    // hardware has one opinion.
    //
    // The policy is AGREE-OR-BYPASS. If every active receiver wants the same
    // filter, engage it — the common case, since an operator usually spreads
    // slices within a band. If they disagree, release every relay (kOcNone)
    // rather than pick a winner.
    //
    // Picking a winner is the tempting alternative and it is worse: a low-pass
    // chosen for 40 m ATTENUATES a receiver listening on 15 m, so three of the
    // four panadapters would show a signal level that is an artefact of the
    // fourth receiver's tuning. Bypass is honest — every receiver sees the same
    // unfiltered front end, and a level comparison between panadapters means
    // something.
    //
    // WHAT THIS COSTS, stated plainly: bypass drops the AM-broadcast HPF, and on
    // the HL2 that filter matters more than on radios with better dynamic range
    // (oracle §8). Near a broadcast transmitter, spanning bands can therefore
    // raise the noise floor on EVERY receiver. That is a real trade the operator
    // makes by putting receivers on different bands, and it is logged below so
    // the cause is visible rather than mysterious.
    //
    // TRANSMIT is not affected by the bypass decision, because transmit is what
    // the low-pass is legally there for. See the TX-receiver override below.
    // WHICH DIRECTION ARE WE IN. The relay bank is one piece of hardware and it
    // is either in the receive path, the transmit path, or both — that is the
