// openHPSDR Ethernet Protocol 2 wire primitives for the ANAN-G2 backend.
//
// Direct C++ port of the live-validated anan/spike/phase1a.py spike (aetherd
// ANAN P2 Phase 1a), run against a real ANAN-G2 (Saturn, protocol 4.3,
// firmware/gateware 27) on the bench. Protocol facts are grounded clean-room
// in the openHPSDR Ethernet Protocol v4.4 (Phil Harman VK6PH,
// TAPR/OpenHPSDR-Firmware; see THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES), the Saturn FPGA RTL,
// and p2app -- the radio-side Protocol 2 server and the counterparty on the
// wire, per the RFC's provenance model
// (docs/architecture/anan-p2-backend-design.md §2.9). Every non-obvious
// field cites the spec page it comes from, the way MetisProtocol.h does for
// Protocol 1.
//
// This layer is intentionally socket-free and Qt-free so it unit-tests
// against captured/synthetic frames without hardware; P2Client (a later
// commit) owns the UDP sockets and RX ingest thread and calls into these
// functions.
//
// TRANSMIT: there is no encoder for a DUC-Specific packet, TX drive, or PTT
// anywhere in this file. That is not a guard that can be bypassed -- the
// capability does not exist yet. TX is RFC §2.11 Phase 3, a separate future
// addition, gated behind the engine's TX arbiter above the seam
// (Constitution Principle VI: AetherSDR never transmits without operator
// intent).
//
// buildSpeakerAudio() is NOT a transmit encoder, and the distinction is the
// whole reason this paragraph now has to say so. It carries already-demodulated
// RECEIVER audio to the radio's own speaker codec on kSpeakerAudioPort. Nothing
// in it reaches the DUC, the PA or the T/R relay, it is accepted by p2app while
// the radio is receiving, and it cannot key anything. The claim above still
// holds exactly as written: no DUC-Specific, no drive, no PTT.

// General/DDC-Specific and High-Priority carry no shared "packet type" byte
// the way Discovery/General do (buildDdcSpecific()'s byte 4 is "number of
// ADCs", buildHighPriority()'s byte 4 is the run/PTT bitfield -- neither is
// a command discriminator), so the radio tells these two packet types apart
// by which port they arrive on. Sending either to kRadioPort instead is

// IncomingSpkrAudio() and DMAs it to the speaker codec FIFO.

// packet was SENT FROM, matching the spec's literal "Destination Port: the
// Source Port of the Host that initiated Discovery" rule for every radio->PC
// stream (p.43, p.51, p.54) -- not a fixed per-DDC port on the PC side.

// Discovery reply all share the PC-side socket, so "not a DDC port" is an
// ordinary, expected answer rather than an error.
//
// basePort + n is verified against p2app's own source, not just the spec,
// and the two independent paths there agree:
//   * generalpacket.c assigns DDC i the port `SetPort(VPORTDDCIQ0+i, Port+i)`
//     when the General packet carries a non-zero DDC0 port (bytes 17-18).
//   * When that field is ZERO -- which is exactly what buildGeneral() sends,
//     per the spec's "if set to zero the default port will be used" -- SetPort
//     falls back to p2app's DefaultPorts[] table, whose VPORTDDCIQ0..9 entries
//     (indices 8-17) are 1035..1044. The same 1035 + n sequence.
// So this holds whether or not a client ever negotiates the port, which is
// what makes kDdc0DefaultPort usable as the default base here.
//
// This is the ONLY thing that separates one DDC's stream from another's: the
// DDC I&Q packet itself carries no DDC index field anywhere (spec pp.53-54,
// checked byte by byte). p2app ships each DDC through its own dedicated
// socket rather than combining them, so the spec's "Synchronous DDC"

// Ambiguity with the Discovery reply, stated because both are 60 bytes: a reply
// has bytes 0-3 all zero and byte 4 of 0x02/0x03, while this packet's bytes 0-3

// sequence 0 with PTT bits that happen to read 0x02 or 0x03, and the caller tries
// the Discovery parse first, so the reply wins that tie.
//
// WHICH REQUIRES THE CALLER TO TRY IT ON EVERY DATAGRAM, not only until the first
// reply has been acted on. A reply parse gated on "have I announced discovery yet"
// leaves every later reply -- a duplicate, a retransmit, a reply to another
// client's broadcast on this socket -- landing here, where its byte 30 bit 3
// decodes as a speaker-FIFO underflow that never happened. Announce once; parse
