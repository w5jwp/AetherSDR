// IRadioBackend implementor for the ANAN-G2 (openHPSDR Protocol 2). Owns one
// P2Client (the UDP session) and one AnanRxDsp (the WDSP demod + spectrum
// chain) on a dedicated I/O thread, mirroring how Hl2Backend owns MetisClient
// + Hl2RxDsp. Below the seam; RadioModel sees only this class.
//
// SCOPED TO aetherd ANAN P2 Phase 1b (02-working-plan.md Step 2): one DDC,
// RX only. Several things Hl2Backend's current (evolved) implementation does
// are deliberately absent here, not forgotten — see the design plan this was
// built from for the reasoning:
//   - No "keep the DDC fixed, move a WDSP shift" optimization. This backend
//     retunes DDC0 directly on every setSliceFrequency()/setPanCenter() call.
//     A direct consequence: the shift this class pushes to AnanRxDsp is
//     ALWAYS exactly -cwBfoHz(mode) -- there is no NCO-vs-slice offset term,
//     because the NCO IS the slice frequency, always.
//   - No live discovery read in connectRadio() -- capabilities() reports
//     hardcoded identity strings, matching Hl2Backend's own capabilities()
//     (its model string is hardcoded too).
//   - setKeying() is a guarded no-op. canTransmit is false and P2Client has
//     no PTT capability to call even if this method wanted to -- TX is a
//     separate, later addition (RFC §2.11 Phase 3), not a flag flip here.
//
// Receive handedness correctness is NOT this class's concern -- it lives
// entirely in AnanRxDsp's own conjugate split, unaffected by anything here.
// As of 2026-08-21 it's CONFIRMED, not just structurally borrowed from the
// HL2: `radiocert rx` plus an independent RSP1B/SDR++ receiver both agree.
// See AnanRxDsp.h and HERMES.md §16 for the full account.
