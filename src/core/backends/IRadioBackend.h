// The radio-facing seam of the engine (aetherd RFC §5.5). Everything that

// libaethercore; RadioModel and the (future) protocol see only this. The
// SmartSDR stack becomes the first implementor (FlexBackend, step 2.2) with
// ZERO behavior change; other radio families are added as further implementors
// without touching any client.
//
// Design decisions (RFC §5.5 open questions, resolved 2026-07-05):
//   Q2 — RadioModel keeps owning its sub-models (SliceModel, MeterModel, …);
//        the backend DRIVES them by emitting the signals below, which
//        RadioModel connects to. The backend does not own UI-facing model
//        objects. (Minimal churn; the models already communicate via signals.)
//   Q3 — ONE interface, not an RX-only/TX-capable type split. A receive-only
//        family reports capabilities().canTransmit == false and implements
//        setKeying() as a guarded no-op; the engine TX guard (RFC §6, above
//        this seam) denies keying when canTransmit is false.
//
// DSP location is invisible here (RFC §5.5): a backend whose hardware
// demodulates and computes FFTs is a thin protocol decoder; one that ships raw
// samples owns an engine-side DSP chain — either way it emits the same
// normalized signals, so no consumer can tell the difference.
//
// ---- THREADING AND LIFETIME CONTRACT ----------------------------------------
//
// Every implementor honours the following, and backend_seam_affinity_test /
// backend_family_switch_test pin it. A backend that needs an exception does
// not take one quietly: it changes this text first.
//
//  1. THE BACKEND OBJECT LIVES ON ITS OWNER'S THREAD. RadioModel constructs
//     the backend on the thread RadioModel itself lives on (the GUI thread in
//     the desktop app, the daemon's main thread in aetherd) and never moves
//     it. Every virtual on this interface is called on that thread, and a
//     backend may assume so — no verb needs a lock against another verb.
//
//  2. EVERY SEAM SIGNAL IS EMITTED FROM THAT THREAD. This includes the
//     high-rate data plane (audioFrameReady, sliceAudioFrameReady,
//     spectrumFrameReady, meterUpdate) and the cadence
//     signals (linkStatsUpdated). A backend whose socket, DSP or timer lives
//     on a worker thread brings the result back to its own thread FIRST — a
//     queued connection with `this` as the receiver context, or
//     QMetaObject::invokeMethod(this, …) — and emits from there. It never
//     emits a seam signal from inside a worker-thread callback, a
//     Qt::DirectConnection lambda bound to a worker-thread sender, or a
//     std::function the worker invokes.
//
//     Consequence for consumers: RadioModel may connect to any seam signal
//     with the default (Auto) connection type and get a direct call, in
//     order, with no re-entrancy across threads. Consumers must NOT rely on
//     Qt::DirectConnection to reach a worker thread through the seam — there
//     is no such thread to reach.
//
//  3. WORKERS ARE THE BACKEND'S PRIVATE BUSINESS. Threads, sockets, DSP
//     objects and their affinity are implementation detail. Nothing above the
//     seam may observe, name, or wait on them; a consumer that needs a
//     backend-side value asks the backend on the backend's thread
//     (healthSnapshot(), linkStats(), dspChains()) and the backend answers
//     from its own cache — see the SYNCHRONOUS note on healthSnapshot().
//
//     TRANSITIONAL EXCEPTION, and the only one: FlexBackend::connection() /
//     panStream() and SimBackend's equivalents are backend-owned wire objects
//     living on worker threads that RadioModel still harvests and drives
//     directly — including Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection invokes — while the
//     command plane moves behind the seam (#5262 M4, #5554 §2.6). They are the
//     only objects above the seam that may wait on a backend thread, no new
//     call site may join them, and every handler bound to them is
//     generation-guarded per rule 5. When M4 lands, this paragraph goes.
//
//  4. SEAM PAYLOADS ARE DECLARED AND REGISTERED IN ONE PLACE. Every value
//     type that crosses the seam (the *Delta structs, MeterDef, LinkStats) is
//     declared with Q_DECLARE_METATYPE in its own header AND registered with
//     qRegisterMetaType in RadioModel's constructor. A new payload type adds
//     itself to both, in the same change that introduces it.
//
//     This is NOT what makes a queued connection deliver. On Qt 6 moc embeds
//     each signal parameter's QMetaType in the meta-object and a
//     pointer-to-member-function connection self-registers at connect time, so
//     a queued seam signal delivers with neither line present — the Qt 5
//     "Cannot queue arguments of type …" failure this rule used to cite does
//     not reproduce here. The registration is for the NAME-based paths that do
//     not go through moc's embedded type: QMetaType::fromName, QVariant round
//     trips, string-based SIGNAL/SLOT connects, and QSignalSpy argument
//     capture (tests/hl2_backend_test.cpp relies on exactly that). Registering
//     in one place keeps those working and keeps the answer to "is this a seam
//     payload?" in a single list.
//
//  5. TEARDOWN IS BOUNDED AND ORDERED. disconnectRadio() returns with no
//     worker still able to reach a seam signal: it stops its sources, quits
//     and joins its threads (or hands them to a self-deleting reaper the way
//     RtlSdrBackend does for a stuck open), and emits disconnected() exactly
//     once, from its own thread, before returning or asynchronously — but
//     never twice and never from a worker. The destructor completes the
//     same drain for a backend destroyed while connected, and must never
//     wait on a BlockingQueuedConnection whose target thread may itself be
//     waiting on this thread — that is the wait cycle the family-switch test
//     exists to catch. RadioModel::teardownBackend() disconnects every seam
//     signal BEFORE destroying the backend, but THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT and a
//     consumer must not believe it is: QObject::disconnect stops new posts and
//     Qt purges a queued QMetaCallEvent only when the RECEIVER dies, so a call
//     already posted by a dying backend (or by a wire object on its worker
//     thread) is still delivered afterwards. What actually drops it is the
//     receiver generation: teardownBackend() bumps a counter, and every
//     handler bound to a backend-owned object captures it and returns early
//     when it no longer matches (RadioModel::setupBackend()). Believing the
//     disconnect was enough is what let a torn-down session's trailing status
//     line delete the next session's slice.
//
//  6. A BACKEND EMITS NOTHING AFTER disconnected(). A frame a worker sent
//     before it was stopped may still be queued when disconnectRadio()
//     returns; the backend gates its re-emit on its own connected flag (see
//     SimBackend's audio forwards) so the seam stays silent once it has said
//     goodbye. sim_backend_test pins this for the reference implementation.
//
// This is the CORE seed. It carries the lifecycle, capability, canonical-verb,
// and extension surface; it grows one method at a time as the touchpoint
// burndown (docs/architecture/aetherd-touchpoints.md) converts each gui→engine
// touchpoint into a protocol/backend verb. Do NOT dump all 140 touchpoints
// here at once.
// Owned by the model, borrowed by a backend. See backends/OfflineHealthSource.h.
