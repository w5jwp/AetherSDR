    // target retreats every step and only a real echo from the radio can end
    // the loop; with no echo that is the 24 dB/s ratchet documented on
    // radioOwnsDbmScale.
    //
    // Declared here rather than beside radioOwnsDbmScale because it is a
    // property of THIS axis, and because the single flag that used to answer

    // its gate: #5725 added it with nothing reading it, and this PR supplies
