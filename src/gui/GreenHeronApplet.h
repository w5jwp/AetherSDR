// GHE tile: antenna ports of the Green Heron "Everyware" switch this radio is
// wired to (other switches' SWITCHLOCKS mark "in use by <switch>"). Owns its
// GreenHeronModel; shows what the device reported, never what we asked for. The
// rotator shares the socket and shows only while a heading is reported. Safety:
//   1. Choosing a heading and sending it are separate gestures (Turn or Enter);
//      the protocol has no stop/park verb, so nothing sends on click or drag.
//   2. The readout is the REPORTED heading with no "on target" verdict (rotor
//      stops ~2° short, overshoots, wanders ±3.8°): "62.9° · asked 64.3° · Δ1.4°".
// RotorCompass (floating tile only) is read-only by invariant 1: no mouse handlers.
