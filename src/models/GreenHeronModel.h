// Wire format: core/GreenHeronProtocol.h. Main-thread only (QTcpSocket + QTimers).
// State is never inferred from commands sent; the device is the sole authority
// and republishes within ~123 ms (rotators settle off the commanded heading).
// Switch roster is announced once and survives a blip; a rotator is announced
// only while its controller is powered and vanishes by going quiet.
