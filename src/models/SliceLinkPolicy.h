// Slice Link (cross-panadapter VFO link) decision logic. Pure policy: the
// MainWindow_Wiring adapter feeds it a link-state snapshot on each
// frequencyChanged from a linked member and applies the Decision.
// Frequencies are integer Hz so echo matching is exact equality.
//
// Peers are set optimistically, so equal-value echoes are usually silent; what
// surfaces is the stale echo train during rapid motion. Status is in-order
// (TCP), so an event matching an unexpired pending write is our echo: consume
// it and everything older, stay quiet (#1524). Anything else is a genuine move
// (radio is authoritative) and propagates. A locked peer suspends propagation;
// an SWR sweep makes the link passive (the sweep restores frequency itself).
// A genuine move onto a still-pending value is misread as an echo; the
// adapter's kSettleMs trailing check re-asserts the last mover if diverged.

namespace AetherSDR::SliceLinkPolicy {
