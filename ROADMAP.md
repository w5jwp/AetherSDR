# AetherSDR Roadmap

Live tracking lives in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues)
and the per-cycle milestone view. This file is a human-readable snapshot
of what the project lead and core contributors are working on — updated
as direction changes.

For *what shipped*, see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Current cycle: post-v26.9.5

### In flight

- **aetherd — vendor-neutral radio backend** ([RFC #3849](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/3849), approved) — extracting an
  `IRadioBackend` seam (`RadioCapabilities` + typed status/command deltas)
  so radio-family logic lives behind a stable interface instead of being
  woven through `RadioModel`. FlexBackend owns the Flex wire objects
  and threads, and the Panadapter / Slice / Meter / Transmit / Amp / Tuner
  status+command paths decode behind the seam (RFC steps 2.1–2.4). The seam
  now carries **six** backends — `FlexBackend`, `HL2Backend`, `IcomCIV`,
  `AnanBackend`, `RtlSdrBackend`, and the synthetic `SimBackend` — which is what
  took it from a design to a proven interface. Bringing a third vendor up on it in v26.8.2 was also the seam's
  best audit to date: it surfaced a meter path that ignored its own unit,
  receive-DSP controls with no verb behind them, and a capability conflating
  "the host modulates" with "TX audio leaves through the seam". The versioned protocol (RFC step 3+) has
  since landed in increments: v26.9.3 added **Stage 3** capability-qualified
  local receive control (mode, filter, audio gain and mute, panadapter center
  and bandwidth) with bounded read-only telemetry, and opened **Stage 4** with
  an engine-local `TxCoordinator` for primary desktop transmit intent. The
  daemon stays observe-only unless `--allow-local-control` is passed. v26.9.4
  continued Stage 4: desktop TX producer ownership survives queued work, and
  **credential-bound TX grants** bind independent clients to actors on the
  `TxCoordinator` behind `--allow-local-tx` and a native-vault credential
  authority that fails closed, with a qualified software-PTT handoff for Flex
  radios on SmartSDR TCP API 1.4 over LAN. Startup remains disarmed. v26.9.5
  began the #5554 physical relocation: the Flex wire classes now live in
  `src/core/backends/flex/`, and `RadioConnection` no longer includes the
  simulator. The seam's probe table is generated from `IRadioBackend.h`, so a
  declared signal cannot go unprobed. Remaining:
  per-client propagation, transmit for SmartLink and the other families,
  transmit audio transport, and a replacement thin UI client — UI code still
  consumes models directly, and that remains correct until that client exists.
- **Icom networked radios — early; the IC-7300MK2 is supported** — `IcomCIV` speaks CI-V inside the RS-BA1
  UDP transport, brought up in v26.8.2 against a live **IC-705** (RX, scope,
  transmit, and FT8 both decoding and spotting on PSK Reporter) and an
  **IC-7300** (RX, scope and stability; transmit unverified). Only the IC-705
  and IC-7300MK2 are `verified` against their own CI-V guides ([RFC #5517](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/5517),
  approved, promotes the IC-7300MK2 to Supported); an unknown model
  gets no scope and no transmit rather than optimistic defaults. v26.8.3 gave
  the backend a **command plane**: every meter read, control write,
  reconciliation poll and PTT transition goes through one CI-V scheduler with
  explicit priorities, coalescing and stale-reply rejection — written because a
  delayed PTT-OFF reply arriving after a newer PTT-ON was cutting transmit
  audio. It also completed the **IC-7300MK2** control surface (18
  operator-visible defects), fixed the **RS-BA1 lease renewal** that froze the
  panadapter at the 255→256 sequence boundary, made **DATA mode** actually reach
  the radio for DIGU/DIGL and DFM, and replaced the hardcoded `0xA4` connect
  address with a broadcast `19 00` query. **WSPR** transmits (20 PSK Reporter
  reception reports on the air), **PC Audio** switches the model-specific DATA OFF
  modulation input, and the built-in CW decoder opens on normalized `CWU`.
  v26.9.5 implemented RFC #5517 in the app: an IC-7300MK2 identified by CI-V
  over built-in Ethernet/RS-BA1 connects as a **supported** radio, with no
  experimental badge or disclaimer, while every other model keeps the
  experimental treatment. Remaining: transmit confirmation on additional Icom
  models, the per-model SET-menu item numbers the MOD Input check needs, audio
  gain/mute/pan, VOX and CW break-in, an automation verb making the modulation
  sources assertable without parsing Radio Health text, and the once-a-second
  FT8 transmit dropout still under investigation.
- **ANAN-G2 — experimental, receive-only** ([RFC #4970](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/4970), approved) — openHPSDR Protocol 2 discovery
  with a single receive path, spectrum and audio, live tuning and zoom, arrived
  in v26.9.2. v26.9.3 removed the session rebuild behind a zoom change — `p2app`
  services DDC-Specific packets in a continuous loop and its "something changed"
  hook is empty, so a rate change is just a resend — and taught the wire layer
  multi-DDC encode with per-sender-port demux, because the DDC I&Q packet
  carries no index field. v26.9.4 shipped DDC0 droop-correction defaults
  derived from the Saturn gateware — the CIC and 1024-tap FIR are fully
  specified in the FPGA sources, so an unswept radio gets a corrected FFT on
  first connect, with the in-app calibration still available — cropped the
  panadapter's true edge instead of fading it, and gave the radio back its
  noise-floor auto-adjust. v26.9.5 computed the panadapter with WDSP's display
  analyzer, so no IQ is discarded between frames and FFT AVG drives it, at one
  point per screen pixel; published the S-meter; ran WDSP's noise blanker from
  the NB button; and drove the ADC step attenuator from RF Gain. The codec is
  multi-DDC capable but `AnanBackend` still drives one; remaining is the
  `AnanRxDsp` fan-out, then transmit.
- **RTL-SDR — experimental, receive-only** — `librtlsdr` discovery with one
  panadapter and one host-demodulated slice (AM, FM, SSB, CW) on builds carrying
  the libraries, from v26.9.2. v26.9.3 added a bounded receiver lifecycle
  foundation and device-identity persistence, plus a `SharedCapturePolicy` that
  requires every receiver's complete guarded passband to fit the shared capture
  before a tune, filter, mode or rate change is admitted. That policy is written
  and tested but not yet wired to a live backend. v26.9.4 landed RFC #5468's
  A3 and A4 increments: rate-aware QSO recording and WAV playback, and TCI
  receive audio that preserves the producer's 24/48 kHz rate and stereo.
  v26.9.5 landed A5: CW, RTTY and AetherClock decode the selected slice's typed
  PCM. Remaining: selectable sharp passband filtering, and the USB/DSP/audio/viewport
  integration that turns the policy into real multi-receiver capture.
- **Workspace canvas — experimental** — [RFC #4887](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/4887) landed complete in v26.8.3,
  all seven phases: pans and applets as freely placed, resizable, layered items
  on a canvas that can span several top-level windows, with named workspaces,
  full-recall switching and radio-profile bindings. It is **off by default**, and
  an install that never enables it never gains a settings key. Remaining before
  the experimental label can come off: live cross-window drag (deferred this
  cycle — a cross-top-level reparent is the #2495/#4617/#4319 crash lineage, so
  moves go through one deliberate menu path for now), and field time on real
  stations against the Classic shell.
- **Hermes-Lite 2 — from experimental to supported** — the backend arrived
  experimental in v26.7.4 and grew most of the way to parity in v26.8.1: four
  independent receivers, the SSB voice chain, CW/RTTY decoding and the QSO
  recorder, AX.25 packet with an on-air-proven mailbox, band switching with
  hardware filters and preamp, host-side memory channels, per-MAC operating-state
  restore with per-band drive/LNA memory, live connection health and a Radio
  Health dialog. v26.8.2 added **manual notch filters** and **manual frequency
  calibration**, DC-blocked the AM/SAM audio, and unfroze the first connect.
  v26.8.3 gave it a working **NB** button (WDSP's impulse blanker on the raw IQ,
  the only place it can run on this radio), a **real BFO** so a CW passband
  straddles the marker instead of sitting where a USB filter would, **AGC mode
  and threshold that survive a restart**, and a **TX ALC that no longer
  normalises away a TCI/DAX client's own level control**. Its meter surface is
  now certified against physical hardware. v26.9.4 was the largest step since
  v26.8.1: the **transmit chain moved to WDSP's TXA modulator** and it is the
  default, after ON8ST keyed it into a dummy load and onto an antenna; the ALC
  only ever reduces and the Mic Level slider is the transmit level; the modes
  the phasing modulator could not transmit in are declared, so AM no longer
  keys suppressed-carrier SSB; the **dBm reference is derived** (+3 dBm full
  scale at 0 dB LNA gain); the **S-meter reads WDSP's average** rather than a
  decaying peak-hold that read the noise floor 11–14 dB high; the wideband
  bandscope (endpoint 4) is decoded with an on-demand converter view; automatic
  RF gain drives on measured headroom (RFC #5535, shipped off until the LNA
  default reconciles with the arming baseline); and pan-bandwidth chains are
  built off the I/O thread, so a zoom no longer stalls EP2 and silences the
  radio. v26.9.5 ran the RX bandpass at **minimum phase outside CW**, cutting
  receive latency by 84 ms (44 ms back after an unmute instead of 128 ms);
  deferred the unmute past the T/R turnaround so the PA's own carrier no longer
  reaches the demodulator; let the operator declare the board variant (bare
  HL2, AK4951 companion, SquareSDR 2); routed the second receiver's S-meter to
  its slice; and made the client re-ask a silent radio to stream before declaring
  the link down.
  **The experimental → supported call itself is still open**; what remains
  before making it is panadapter/waterfall parity with the Flex path, arming
  automatic RF gain by default, and field time on the TXA chain beyond one
  station. Two known costs are on the record rather than hidden: CW keeps the
  8192-tap linear-phase filter's full latency, and the 0.6–1.1 s pan-bandwidth
  rebuild is off the audio path but still a wait.
- **AppSettings nested-JSON refactor** — ~460 flat call sites today;
  the new pattern is one nested-JSON value per feature (Principle V).
  The storage layer moved to SQLite and the scoped feature-document store,
  BandStack and memory-bank fold-ins, and the Settings Browser all shipped in
  v26.8.1 (RFC #4603, PRs 1–6). New radio-scoped configuration lands as
  versioned feature documents in `radio_settings`; the remaining work is
  migrating the legacy flat keys feature-by-feature.
- **Flathub submission** — the AppStream metainfo and manpage landed in
  v26.6.4; the actual Flathub PR + manifest is the remaining step.

### Queued (next cycle)

- **KiwiSDR follow-ups** — WebSDR / OpenWebRX support on top of the shipped
  public-receiver browser (per-receiver passwords, idle-release, and
  waterfall polish landed in v26.7.2; warm audio through TX and the
  resume-after-TX-delay option in v26.8.1).
- **Extended region band plans** — DXCC entities outside IARU R1/R2/R3.
- **macOS VirtualAudioBridge audit** ([#2940](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/2940))

### Recently shipped

Highlights from the current cycle (v26.9.x). Earlier releases and the
complete list are in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md):

- **Split remembers your audio arrangement** — the transmit slice's mute, level
  and pan and the receive slice's pan come back on every split, learned only
  from the operator's own edits, with **Monitor TX (Hold)** and **Split Up
  1 / 5 / 10 kHz**. Closes #2242 (v26.9.5).
- **AetherRX and AetherTX live controls** — BYPASS, REC and PLAY at the foot of
  each stage column, RX BYPASS covering every NR method, and **TX Playback** of
  the last client-side recording (v26.9.5).
- **Stereo noise reduction on every method** — NR2, NR4, DFNR, NNR, BNR and MNR
  denoise left and right independently, so a pan is instant instead of taking
  about 5 s, and diversity keeps one antenna per ear (v26.9.5).
- **A Window menu** — the open windows listed with Minimize, Zoom, Full Screen
  and Bring All to Front; Minimal Mode moves to Ctrl+Shift+M (v26.9.5).
- **The ANAN-G2 panadapter, S-meter, noise blanker and attenuator** — WDSP's
  display analyzer at one point per screen pixel, an S-meter shared with the
  HL2, the impulse blanker and RF-gain attenuation (v26.9.5).
- **The Hermes-Lite 2 hears 84 ms sooner** — minimum-phase RX filtering outside
  CW, and no more PA carrier in the receiver after an unkey (v26.9.5).
- **The IC-7300MK2 is supported** — over built-in Ethernet/RS-BA1 it connects
  with no experimental badge or disclaimer. RFC #5517 (v26.9.5).
- **rigctl `STRENGTH` reports a real level** — every hamlib client on every
  backend had been handed a constant −57 dB (v26.9.5).
- **The Glacier waterfall palette**. RFC #5670 (v26.9.5).
- **AetherRX and AetherTX, one window each** — the receive and transmit chains
  as a stage column down the left (enable checkbox and drag-to-reorder grip per
  stage) and one page per stage, sharing the column, page frame and profile
  machinery. Each side gets a profile library stored as one nested-JSON
  document; channel-strip presets are retired and split once into their two
  halves on first open (v26.9.4).
- **WDSP 2.10 and Neural Noise Reduction** — the vendored WDSP moves to 2.10
  and NNR becomes the seventh client-side NR method with its full control
  surface, the real 24 kHz-path latency declared to the stereo adapter, and
  persistence that survives a restart. NR2 gains WDSP's psychoacoustic
  post-processing, and the minimum-phase FIR workspace is built only when
  minimum phase is on. RFC #5684 (v26.9.4).
- **Global precipitation on the PSK Reporter map** — an opt-in LibreWXR
  overlay with NOAA, ECCC and EUMETNET OPERA regional backups, a per-provider
  intensity legend and default-off coverage shading. RFC #5630 (v26.9.4).
- **The Hermes-Lite 2 transmits through WDSP** — the TXA modulator is the
  default after it was keyed into a load and onto an antenna, the ALC only
  reduces, engine-generated audio keeps its own level, the modes the phasing
  modulator could not transmit in are declared, and the S-meter and dBm
  reference read what the hardware actually delivers (v26.9.4).
- **TGXL and PGXL front panels** — both 4O3A applets lay themselves out like
  the device's own panel when popped out or on the canvas. The tuner learns
  that `autotune` is a toggle (TUNE becomes STOP) and shows the device's alert
  channel; the amplifier gains a drive meter and one owner for its relayed and
  direct meters; and the tuner is metered from its own `peak` at ~60 Hz while
  keyed, so voice no longer reads as the gaps between syllables (v26.9.4).
- **aetherd transmit grants** — credential-bound TX grants for independent
  clients behind `--allow-local-tx` and a fail-closed native-vault authority,
  with qualified Flex software-PTT handoff over the SmartSDR TCP API. Startup
  stays disarmed (v26.9.4).
- **A three-state control doctrine** — unavailable, inactive and active, with
  an availability registry so unsupported controls stay visible, disabled and
  carry a reason. #5262 M3a, toward the #4896 accessibility commitment
  (v26.9.4).
- **Copy Assist stops taking the app down** — a GPU without room for the model
  fails the load and retries on CPU, faults inside discovery or load leave
  flushed stage records in the log, and a slow model drops audio at a bounded
  backlog instead of queueing forever (v26.9.4).
- **An optional DeepFist CW receive backend** — behind `CwRxModel`, off by
  default at build time, with ggmorse unchanged as the default decoder
  (v26.9.4).
- **A Tools-first menu bar** — the top level becomes
  `File · Settings · Profiles · Tools · View · Help`, collecting the operating
  tools that were scattered across File, Settings, View and Help under one
  **Tools** menu placed ahead of **View**, because operators reach for them more
  often than for display settings. Existing actions and handlers are reused, so
  shortcuts and lifecycle behavior are unchanged and only discoverability moves.
  RFC #5570 (v26.9.3).
- **Clock-aligned waterfall time markers** — thin UTC-labelled lines at 15 s to
  15 minute intervals, snapped to clock boundaries and pinned to the signal rows
  they were captured with, so they stay correct through scrolling, pause, resize
  and a waterfall rate change. Off by default, persisted per panadapter slot
  (v26.9.3).
- **An APRS WIDE1-1 fill-in digipeater** — an AetherModem tab that substitutes
  MYCALL with the H bit on the first matching unused hop. It requires the shared
  1200-baud profile, a valid callsign and explicit per-session arming, and
  deliberately never restores arming from settings; wide-area WIDEn-N
  decrementing is still Phase 2 (v26.9.3).
- **Weather radar and night lights on PSK Reporter** — NOAA radar with playback
  and the NASA city-lights basemap, both behind retry handling so a transient
  tile failure no longer leaves the layer blank. A dark map style and brightness
  controls join them, and the controls move into a left sidebar (v26.9.3).
- **Web-888 as its own receiver family** — the KiwiSDR receive path now
  distinguishes Web-888, replaying its waterfall setup once the bare `wf_setup`
  marker is fully processed and invalidating the cached view so an unchanged
  zoom is actually resent. Saved receivers keep their family; legacy entries
  default to KiwiSDR (v26.9.3).
- **The Runtime Monitor Overview** — CPU Total, Max Thread, resident memory and
  GUI Tick Lag as cards and charts over 1 min to 1 h. CPU is whole-process
  cumulative time normalized by core count, so work from threads that start and
  exit between samples is not lost (v26.9.3).
- **aetherd gains control, not just observation** — Stage 3 adds
  capability-qualified local receive methods (mode, filter, audio gain and mute,
  panadapter center and bandwidth) with bounded read-only telemetry, and Stage 4
  adds an engine-local `TxCoordinator` for primary desktop transmit intent. The
  daemon stays observe-only unless `--allow-local-control` is passed, and no
  transmit grants exist yet (v26.9.3).
- **The `IRadioBackend` threading and lifetime contract is pinned by tests** —
  and writing those tests exposed a rule-5 gap that the same change closes.
  Backends now announce capability revisions, family verbs are gated on the
  declared namespace, and the capability-bool population is frozen in CI so the
  seam cannot quietly widen (v26.9.3).
- **ANAN-G2 stops rebuilding the session to change zoom** — `p2app` shows the
  radio services DDC-Specific packets in a continuous loop and its "something
  changed" hook is empty, so a rate change is just a resend. One scroll-wheel
  notch cost a mute, stop, 2000 ms settle and a 6000 ms connect window before
  this. The wire layer also gained multi-DDC encode and per-port demux (v26.9.3).
- **Concurrent TCI DAX IQ skimming** — four independent DAX IQ subscriptions let
  compatible Flex setups feed several CW skimmers through one TCI server.
  Receivers on one panadapter share its IQ stream, so four independent band
  spectra still need four panadapters (v26.9.2).
- **Experimental ANAN-G2 and RTL-SDR reception** — openHPSDR Protocol 2
  discovery with a single receive path for the G2, and a single slice and
  panadapter with host demodulation for RTL-SDR dongles. Both are receive-only
  and neither is a supported family (v26.9.2).
- **The SPE floating front panel** — a live amplifier LCD mirror with guarded
  front-panel keys, alongside TelePost LP-100A wattmeter readings over local
  serial or a serial-to-network proxy (v26.9.2).
- **Icom identifies itself over the wire** — model identification now comes from
  CI-V rather than an editable network nickname, with optional wake on connect
  behind model-specific profiles for the IC-705, IC-7300MK2 and IC-9700. Wake
  defaults off (v26.9.2).
- **A broad IC-7300MK2 control cleanup** — TX bandwidth encoding, the 6–48 WPM
  CW range, 5 Hz CW pitch steps, squelch that stays usable in CW and data modes,
  and refusal rather than silent substitution when a control is unsupported.
  Model-specific mappings stay separate so no MK2 behavior is imposed on other
  Icom radios (v26.9.2).
- **The KiwiSDR directory moves to a CDN mirror** — the public-receiver browser
  reads from the AetherSDR mirror, and stale directory data is advisory so
  operators keep browsing receivers that are still reachable (v26.9.2).
- **Green Heron Everyware antenna control** — a native applet for compatible
  antenna switches and rotators (v26.9.1).
- **A globe projection for PSK Reporter** — operators can switch from the flat
  map to a global view of received reports (v26.9.1).
- **System Info Threads and Logs tabs** — runtime diagnosis moves inside the
  app instead of requiring external tooling (v26.9.1).
- **Radio-authoritative Icom memories** — read-only IC-9700 radio memory,
  model-gated controls and telemetry, and safer reconnect and TX lifecycle
  behavior, with DTCS and multi-radio NAT support (v26.9.1).

## How to influence the roadmap

- **Open an issue** with the feature-request template if you want
  something specific. The AetherClaude orchestrator triages it within
  minutes.
- **Open a PR** if you've already built it — see
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Most cleanup-class work
  AetherClaude can do autonomously; novel features benefit from a
  design discussion in the issue first.
- **Sponsor a feature** — email the project lead at
  `kk7gwy@aethersdr.com`. Sponsored work jumps the queue while
  remaining open-source.

This roadmap is intentionally short. Long roadmaps don't ship.
