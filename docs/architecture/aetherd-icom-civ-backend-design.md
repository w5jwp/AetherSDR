# Icom CI-V Backend — Design Note

Model-specific command capability and evidence are defined in
[`icom-capability-profiles.md`](icom-capability-profiles.md), implementing the
profile foundation from RFC issue #4984 without widening `IRadioBackend`.

Bring-up plan for `IcomCivBackend`, an `IRadioBackend` implementor for Icom
networked radios. First targets: **IC-705 over WiFi** and **IC-7300MK2 over
Ethernet**.

The protocol reference is the oracle at `~/oracles/icom/icom-oracle.md`, with
primary sources under `~/oracles/icom/sources/`. This note does not restate the
wire format; it covers what AetherSDR has to build and in what order.

Companion to `aetherd-hl2-backend-design.md`, and deliberately shaped like it.

## 0. Current bring-up status (2026-08-21)

The backend is no longer a phase-1 sketch. It is an operating CI-V/RS-BA1
implementation, but its evidence is deliberately recorded at three different
levels: a model-specific guide can prove a command exists, automated fake-radio
tests can prove AetherSDR sends and adopts the right frames, and only a live
radio can prove the operator experience.

| Model | Current evidence | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **IC-705 (`A4`)** | Model profile checked against its CI-V guide; live RX, scope, TX, FT8/WSPR, controls and meters. The FM repeater/TONE controls, local-memory recall and momentary XFC path in this increment were all exercised successfully by the operator on 2026-08-21. | Primary fully brought-up model. Regional tuning gaps still cannot be represented by the seam's single min/max range. |
| **IC-7300MK2 (`B6`)** | Model profile checked against its own CI-V guide; live Ethernet RX/scope, control surface, meters, ATU, WSPR, PC Audio routing and CW decoder. Its guide attests the basic repeater and XFC families. | The basic tone/offset/XFC surface is profile-enabled from guide evidence but has not had the IC-705 operator workflow repeated on this model. |
| **IC-9700 (`A2`)** | Live RS-BA1 scope geometry and `26 00` VFO/mode replies have been observed. Its profile records official-guide plus PR #5149 live-wire evidence for the basic/extended repeater and XFC command families. | This increment's selected-receiver UX still needs an IC-9700 operator pass; AetherSDR does not yet independently model MAIN and SUB repeater state. |
| **Other/unknown Icom** | Identity may be discovered, and conservative common controls can be read. | Fail closed: absent profile facets mean no repeater reads/writes or XFC capability, with no fallback by CI-V address. |

### FM repeater and XFC state contract

The controls added in this increment use the model-neutral slice/radio seam; no
GUI code knows a CI-V byte. The mapping is:

| Operator state | CI-V | Convergence |
|---|---|---|
| Repeater TONE off/on | `16 42 00/01` | Read at connect, adopted from replies/front-panel traffic, and written only from operator intent. |
| Repeater tone frequency | `1B 00` + three BCD bytes | Read at connect and adopted as one-decimal-hertz radio state. This is the TONE frequency; `16 43` TSQL remains separate and unmapped. |
| Duplex simplex/down/up | `0F 10/11/12` | Read at connect and reflected as simplex, `-`, or `+`. |
| Repeater offset magnitude | read `0C`, write `0D`, 100 Hz units | Kept unsigned on the wire; the duplex direction determines the signed TX offset shown by the slice model. |
| Transmit-frequency check | `1C 02 00/01` | Gated by the active model's `TxFrequencyCheck` evidence and FM repeater facet. XFC is momentary: press sends ON; release, window deactivation, control hide, and disconnect send OFF. A 250 ms readback poll catches front-panel changes without requiring CI-V Transceive. |

The IC-705 and IC-9700 additionally activate the extended snapshot (`16 5D`,
`1B 01`, `1B 02`, and `1C 03`) through their model-specific
`FmRepeaterExtendedReadback` facets. Both official CI-V guides define the same
access-mode values and DTCS code/polarity register; IC-9700 also has preserved
live-wire evidence. `16 5D`, receive CTCSS, and DTCS code/polarity are
normalized into `SliceModel`; the shared FM applet and VFO consume the model
profile's access-mode and DTCS-code capabilities without a radio-name check.
Operator DTCS intent writes `1B 02`, while only the radio's confirmation
updates model and diagnostic state. The IC-7300MK2 keeps its existing narrower
activated path, and memory write vocabulary remains outside this phase. The
sanitized IC-9700 source trace and exact field provenance live in
`docs/data/icom-ic9700-fm-repeater-{evidence.json,live-trace.txt}`.

The radio remains authoritative. Connect performs a snapshot of all four FM
repeater fields plus XFC where supported; replies update the models without
being reflected back as commands. Local-memory recall is an explicit operator
intent, so it writes tone enable/frequency, duplex direction and offset, then
the normal CI-V readback path converges the UX. The full recall sequence was
confirmed on a live IC-705, including TONE off/on and duplex `+`, `-`, and
simplex/off.

XFC is intentionally not stored in a memory. It describes a held front-panel
action, not an operating-state setting that should survive release or recall.

## 1. Why Icom is a different kind of backend

The two backends we have bracket the design space, and Icom sits between them in
a way neither anticipated:

| | Flex | HL2 | **Icom** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Demodulation | radio | host | **radio** |
| FFT / spectrum | radio | host | **radio** |
| Raw IQ available | yes (DAX-IQ) | yes (it's all we get) | **no** |
| Command plane | text over TCP | registers in the IQ stream | **CI-V over UDP** |
| State push | full status subscription | telemetry in-band | **CI-V Transceive, partial** |
| Meters | VITA-49 stream | in-band telemetry | **polled, one at a time** |

Flex is *radio-authoritative and rich*: it tells you everything, unprompted.
HL2 is *host-authoritative and raw*: it tells you almost nothing and hands you
samples. Icom is **radio-authoritative and poor** — the radio owns the DSP, the
demodulation and the FFT, but its only way to tell you anything is a 1980s
request/response bus that also carries every command you send.

That combination produces the two structural facts this whole design turns on:

**(a) There is no IQ.** Not over WiFi, not over USB, not at all — confirmed
against Icom's own CI-V Reference Guide, wfview's type system, and the transport
itself (oracle §8.1). The panadapter is a cooked 475-bin, 0–160 display array at
one of eight fixed spans. Everything downstream of raw IQ is unavailable:
host-side FFT sizing, arbitrary zoom, DAX-IQ consumers, CW Skimmer.

The goal as written asks for "control/voice/data/IQ/panadapter". **Four of those
five are achievable and IQ is not.** The panadapter is real and good; the IQ line
item should be struck rather than shipped as a disabled control.

**(b) Meters are polled and share a stream with tuning.** There is no meter
plane. Every S-meter reading is a round trip on the same UDP stream carrying
frequency changes, and on WiFi that is 5–30 ms. This is the first backend where
*metering policy* is a real engineering constraint rather than a subscription.

---

## 2. What `IcomCivBackend` owns

```
src/core/backends/icom/
  IcomCivBackend.{h,cpp}      IRadioBackend implementor; owns the others
  IcomSession.{h,cpp}         RS-BA1 session: handshake, login, token renewal
  IcomStream.{h,cpp}          one UDP stream: seq, ARQ, keepalives (×3 instances)
  IcomSeqBuf.{h,cpp}          reorder + replay buffers (the ARQ layer)
  CivCodec.{h,cpp}            CI-V framing, BCD codecs, frame reassembly
  CivCommands.h               the command table (§4.3 of the oracle)
  IcomScope.{h,cpp}           0x27 waveform decode → spectrum frames
  IcomAudio.{h,cpp}           codec 4 LPCM, the 1364+556 split, resampling
  IcomMeters.{h,cpp}          calibration curves + the poll scheduler
  IcomModels.h                per-model capability table (IC-705 first)
```

`IcomStream` existing three times — control, serial, audio — with independent
sequence spaces and ARQ state is the shape the protocol dictates, and it is worth
resisting the urge to collapse it. kappanhang's `streamCommon` is exactly this
and it is the cleanest part of that codebase.

## 3. Seam mapping

### Intents DOWN

| `IRadioBackend` | Icom mechanism |
|---|---|
| `setSliceFrequency` | CI-V `05` (set operating frequency), 5-byte LE BCD |
| `setSliceMode` | CI-V `06` (mode + filter) |
| `setSliceFilter` | CI-V `1A 03` (IF filter width) — **discrete FIL1/2/3, not continuous** |
| `setSliceAgc` | CI-V `16 12` — FAST/MID/SLOW only; **no threshold**, ignore `thresholdDb` |
| `setPanCenter` | CI-V `05` in Center mode; `27 1E` edges in Fixed mode |
| `setPanBandwidth` | CI-V `27 15` — **snaps to one of eight spans**; report what was taken |
| `setPanRfGain` | CI-V `14 02`, continuous 0000–0255 BCD |
| `setPanPreamp` | CI-V `16 02`, OFF/P.AMP1/P.AMP2 where the model supports them |
| `setPanAttenuator` | CI-V `11`, OFF/20 dB on IC-705 and IC-7300MK2 |
| `setSliceRxAntenna` | CI-V `12 00`, IC-7300MK2 only; ANT1/RX-ANT |
| `setPanFrameRate` | CI-V `27 1A` sweep speed 0/1/2 — mapping to Hz is unmeasured |
| `setKeying` | CI-V `1C 00` (00=RX, 01=TX) |
| `setTune` | **no direct command** — see below |
| `setTxPower` | CI-V `14 0A`, 0000–0255 BCD |
| `setMicGain` | CI-V `14 0B`, 0000–0255 BCD |
| `setTxMonitor` | CI-V `16 45` enable plus `14 15` level |
| `setTxFilter` | CI-V `1A 05 0020/0021/0022` — **discrete WIDE/MID/NAR**, not Hz |
| `submitTxAudio` | audio stream, codec 4 — **requires the model's network source** (WLAN on IC-705, LAN on IC-7300MK2) in `DATA MOD` for data modes and `DATA OFF MOD` for voice |
| `setSliceAudioGain` | CI-V `14 01` (AF level) |
| `createPanadapter` | `false` — one receiver, one scope |

Three of these do not fit the seam cleanly, and all three fit the same pattern:
**the verb is continuous and the radio is discrete.** `setSliceFilter`,
`setPanBandwidth` and `setTxFilter` all take Hz and can only snap. The seam
already anticipates this — `setPanBandwidth`'s own comment says "hz is a REQUEST"
and the result comes back via `panCenterBandwidthChanged`. Follow that contract
exactly: take the request, snap, report what happened. Do not clamp silently.

`setSliceAgc`'s `thresholdDb` has nowhere to go. Ignoring a parameter is the
right call over inventing a mapping, but it should be a documented no-op with a
comment, not a silent drop.

**`setTune` has no Icom command, and the obvious candidate is a different
feature.** `1C 01` is the *antenna tuner* status (`00`=OFF, `01`=ON, `02`=Tune) —
it starts an ATU matching cycle, not a tune carrier. AetherSDR's `setTune(on,
tunePowerPercent)` means "raise a steady carrier at the operator's tune power",
which on an Icom is composed rather than commanded: preserve the operator's
mode, save and apply the temporary tune power via `14 0A`, queue a 1.5 kHz PCM
carrier into the RS-BA1 audio stream, key with `1C 00`, and restore the power on
release. The carrier is generated by a backend-owned 20 ms timer at the radio's
48 kHz rate. It does not borrow microphone-capture callbacks: PC Audio can be
disabled without turning TUNE into a keyed transmitter carrying silence. While
TUNE owns the stream, ordinary `submitTxAudio` callbacks are ignored so two
producers cannot overrun the bounded transmit queue.

The radio's modulation-source selection still applies. In a data mode the
model-specific `DATA MOD` source must be WLAN on IC-705 or LAN on IC-7300MK2;
the backend reads and reports that radio-owned setting rather than silently
overwriting it.

Those are two genuinely different operations and they must not be conflated —
`1C 01 02` belongs on the tuner extension path (`TunerModel`'s autotune intent),
not on `setTune`. A backend that wires the ATU cycle to the TUNE button gives the
operator a button that does nothing on a radio with no ATU attached, and does
something unexpected on one with an AH-705.

### State UP

| Signal | Source |
|---|---|
| `sliceChanged` | CI-V Transceive pushes + polled `03`/`04` |
| `panCenterBandwidthChanged` | the `27 00` waveform header carries centre+span or edges |
| `spectrumFrameReady` | `27 00` waveform data, 475 bins → float (see §6) |
| (waterfall row) | derived by RadioModel from `spectrumFrameReady`; there is no separate seam signal |
| `audioFrameReady` | audio stream, decoded to the engine's PCM format |
| `sliceAudioFrameReady` | same buffer — one slice, so they are the same stream |
| `meterUpdate` | polled `15 xx` through the calibration curves |
| `transmitChanged` | `1C 00` echo + TX meters |
| `radioChanged` | `19 00` model, firmware, connection state |
| `linkStatsUpdated` | per-stream counters + `0x07` ping RTT |
| `healthSnapshot` | OVF (`15 07`), Vd, Id, retransmit and loss counters |

CI-V transceive does not announce every front-panel change. The backend rotates
read requests for RF/power/mic/MON/VOX/notch/preamp/attenuator/tuner state on
the link timer. Tuner reads are omitted for profiles without an evidenced tuner
command path, including the IC-9700. These are state observations, never a
reason to replay a saved client value: supported Icom profiles declare an empty
`clientSettingsDomains`, so the radio remains authoritative across reconnects.

The IC-7300MK2 RX-ANT switch uses a bare `12` read, which returned
`12 00 00` (ANT1) and `12 00 01` (RX-ANT) during the September 2026 Persist run.
The earlier `12 00` read form returned only `FB`; an acknowledgement alone is
not selection readback. The MK2 profile enables startup, periodic and post-write
reads of the working form. Valid replies update the receive antenna model and
scrub mirror without sending a setting command. Reads and writes share one
scheduler generation key. The matcher expects the reply subcommand even though
the query has none, so readback completes the transaction without a timeout.
Malformed and unsupported-model replies are rejected before scheduler completion
or scrub bookkeeping; stale-session replies are discarded at entry. None can
publish selection or make an unread antenna value eligible for scrub. IC-705/IC-9700 do not inherit this command coverage.

### Client-only restart state

The radio still owns its live SQL threshold. Icom Off writes zero, so the
previous manual choice and the client Auto algorithm intent cannot be recovered
from that register. The RX applet stores those two client values in schema-1
`SquelchIntent` (`manualLevel`, `autoEnabled`) under the exact Icom radio scope.
Explicit manual adjustments and mode changes queue a document save. Radio threshold
adoption does not replay a saved threshold: a fresh enabled manual value wins.
An Off reply preserves the remembered manual choice for a later operator click.
Auto resumes only after a current-session enabled SQL report, including a report
already held by a slice when its applet reattaches; an Off radio wins
and cancels the saved Auto intent. Scope changes clear pending restoration, and
newer/unreadable documents are neither interpreted nor overwritten. Flex and
external Kiwi receive keep their existing SQL ownership paths.

When `RadioModel::shapesDisplayRatesLocally()` is true, waterfall cadence is a
client display preference, stored in schema-1 `ClientDisplay.waterfallRates`
under the exact radio scope, indexed by pan slot. Slider/scroll, clone and reset
intents save it; pan wiring restores it before seeding the local rate shaper.
Radio publications and adaptive throttle caps never write that document. Flex
radio-owned cadence continues to use readback and is never restored from this
client feature. Both documents use atomic radio-feature writes, retain unrelated
fields, reject invalid values and refuse unknown identities or future schemas.
UI edits coalesce within 250 ms, capturing their original scope and values.
Pending writes flush on disconnect, owner teardown and normal application quit;
slice or pan reattachment flushes before reading saved intent. SQL report validity
is cleared when session models are staged for reconnect, so cached state from a
previous session cannot start Auto.

### Seam additions made for the second-model bring-up

Two operator intents were absent from `IRadioBackend` and had to cross the
neutral seam:

- `setTxMonitor(bool, int)` separates the radio's MON switch/level from
  `setTxAudioMonitor`, which is the diagnostic receive-during-TX audio gate.
- `setSliceRxAntenna(int, QString)` carries a receive-antenna selection without
  encoding Icom's `12 00` command in GUI code.

Both additions have conservative default implementations, so Flex and HL2 do
not gain a new required override. `TransmitModel` and `SliceModel` also emit
operator-only command signals for these paths. Backend state deltas update the
models without being reflected back down as commands; this is the same
state-versus-intent separation used for RF power in this bring-up.

`sliceAudioFrameReady` and `audioFrameReady` carrying the same buffer is correct
here and worth a comment in the code — with one receiver there is nothing to
un-mix, and a future reader will wonder if it is a bug.

## 4. Capabilities `IcomCivBackend` advertises (IC-705)

```cpp
caps.family                 = "icom";
caps.model                  = "IC-705";        // from CI-V 19 00, never hardcoded
caps.maxSlices              = 1;
caps.maxPanadapters         = 1;
caps.tuningMinHz            = 30e3;
caps.tuningMaxHz            = 470e6;           // with gaps; see note
caps.canTransmit            = true;
caps.txPowerMaxWatts        = 10.0;
caps.hostModulates          = false;           // the radio modulates
caps.hasRadioSideDsp        = true;            // NR/NB/notch are 16 xx, in firmware
caps.hasTuner               = profile.supports(IcomFeature::AntennaTuner); // exact-model evidence
caps.hasTunerMemories       = false;           // 1C 01 has no Flex-style memory API
caps.hasSupplyVoltageTelemetry =
    hasVoltageCalibration(profile.meters.calibration); // explicit model allowlist; 15 15 Vd
caps.hasDaxStreams          = false;           // NO IQ — see oracle §8.1
caps.hasGpsLocation         = true;            // IC-705: 23 00 position/time
caps.hasGpsSatelliteTelemetry = false;         // no count, SNR, or lock flag
caps.hasGpsFrequencyReference = false;         // position GPS, not a GPSDO
caps.hasGpsTimeConfiguration = true;           // NTP + GPS clock settings
caps.hasProfiles            = false;
caps.hasWaveforms           = false;
caps.hasMultiClientSessions = false;
caps.hasRadioSideWaterfallAutoBlack = false;
caps.persistsMemories       = false;           // radio has 99; not phase 1 — see §8
caps.canReboot              = false;           // see note
caps.clientSettingsDomains  = {};              // radio remembers its own state
```

**`hasTuner` is exact-model command capability, not an attachment detector.**
The IC-705 opts in because `1C 01` controls its supported external AH-705 path,
even though attachment cannot be queried. The IC-7300MK2 opts in for its
documented tuner path. The IC-9700 and unprofiled models fail closed: the
backend omits tuner reads and writes. The shared Transmit applet remains stable
across radios by keeping ATU and its indicators visible but dimming them to the
unavailable state when this capability is false. Icom does not publish
`hasTunerMemories`: MEM, its indicator, and memory-only menu actions remain
visible but unavailable rather than inheriting Flex's separate memory API.

**`canReboot = false` despite `18 00` / `18 01` existing.** Those turn the
transceiver off and on — but over WiFi, powering off drops the WLAN interface,
so the `18 01` that would bring it back has no path to reach the radio. The pair
is usable on a wired CI-V bus and is a one-way trip over the network. Advertising
a reboot the operator cannot recover from is worse than not offering it.

**`clientSettingsDomains` empty is the load-bearing line.** Unlike the HL2 — where
the radio reports no VFO and the app must be authoritative — an Icom remembers
its own frequency, mode and filter across power cycles and reports them on
request. Constitution II/III then says the client must not re-assert them. This
backend reads state at connect; it does not push a restored state.

`tuningMaxHz` is a simplification: the IC-705 covers 0.03–470 MHz with gaps
(no 148–430 receive on some regional variants). The seam has no gap
representation, so the honest thing is the outer envelope plus a rejected-tune
path that reports what the radio actually did.

**The GPS claims are intentionally split.** The IC-705's model-specific guide
defines `23 00` for latitude, longitude, altitude, course, speed, and a complete
UTC timestamp; AetherSDR derives the Maidenhead grid locally. It does not define
a satellite count, fix type, SNR, or explicit lock bit, so the UI says
"Position reported" rather than manufacturing "Locked" from valid coordinates.
The GPS feed also does not discipline the RF reference.

The same guide defines NTP Function (`1A 05 0167`), NTP Server Address (`0168`),
GPS Time Correct (`0169`), NTP access (`1A 07`), and its result (`1A 08`). These
are radio-persisted settings: connect and polling only read them. A write occurs
only from an explicit dashboard action and is followed by read-back before the
normalized model publishes the value.

---

## 5. The structural gaps Icom forces

### Gap A — RF gain, preamp, and attenuation are three controls

The original IC-705 bring-up treated RF gain as the three-position preamp. The
model-specific guide and the IC-7300MK2 bench pass showed the actual split:

- `14 02` is continuous RF gain, encoded as a 0000–0255 level and displayed by
  the radio as 0–100 percent;
- `16 02` is the discrete preamp selection; and
- `11` is the discrete attenuator.

They must remain separate through the neutral seam. A smooth RF Gain slider
that sends `16 02`, or a P.AMP button that merely changes `14 02`, moves in the
UI while controlling the wrong RF stage. `setPanRfGain`, `setPanPreamp`, and
`setPanAttenuator` are therefore independent intents; model capability data
decides which preamp positions exist.

The seam parameter still calls RF gain `gainDb`, but Icom publishes no dB
mapping for `14 02`. On this backend the value is explicitly a percentage. Do
not invent a dB scale from the raw register.

### Gap B — metering is a scheduler, not a subscription

Flex streams meters; the HL2 embeds them. Icom uses one CI-V command plane for
meters, startup snapshots, periodic controls and PTT. `IcomCivScheduler` is the
single writer above `IcomSession::sendCiv()` and:

- polls only meters currently visible in the UI;
- paces dispatches into 25 ms slots and permits one ordinary command/reply
  transaction at a time;
- stops TX meters entirely while receiving, and RX meters while transmitting;
- puts operator writes and their radio-authoritative readbacks ahead of polls;
- coalesces duplicate reads and rapid writes by semantic register, preserving
  the newest write generation;
- expires a lost reply after 350 ms and ages background work so PTT or S-meter
  traffic cannot starve slower controls;
- lets fail-safe unkey bypass pacing and the outstanding reply slot; and
- filters its own request/response traffic out of anything re-exported (CAT
  pass-through, TCI) — kappanhang does exactly this and it matters.

The semantic key is deliberately **coarser than the register**: `04`, `06`,
`26` and the transceive forms all key on `mode`, which is what makes an
operator mode write supersede an in-flight mode read of any form. Coalescing
does *not* inherit that coarseness — two reads collapse only when they ask the
same register the same way. `04` (mode) and `26` (mode + DATA + filter) are
both issued at connect on purpose, because `26` is what corrects `04` when the
two disagree.

Aging tops out at the **visible-meter** band, one step below the PTT fallback
poll, not at the poll itself. Dispatch breaks an equal-priority tie in favour
of the older entry, so work that aged all the way to `Ptt` would be dispatched
*ahead* of the keyed-state poll rather than merely tying with it. Stopping one
band short still beats fresh meter traffic on that tie — which is all
anti-starvation needs — while leaving PTT an edge no amount of waiting erodes.
Only one background request may take that meter-band turn before a ready
meter runs. After any background dispatch, aging is capped at `Control`
until an actual `ActiveMeter` dispatch. PTT/operator/emergency requests do
not reset this alternation. This prevents a whole aged reconciliation burst
from draining ahead of fresh TX power/SWR reads. Additionally, once a ready
meter has spent 100 ms in the queue, background aging is capped at `Control`
as well, which protects freshness when dispatches are slower than the
nominal slot.

Both caps are DELAYS, NOT HOLDS, and the difference is the whole design.
`MeterPoller` re-arms each meter from the ANSWER, so on any link whose round
trip is slower than the meter demand there is always a ready meter past its
budget: an overdue-meter cap with no ceiling never lifts, and background work
stops for the session rather than being deferred. Measured on the production
scheduler and poller with an injected clock, that cost every `Control`
reconciliation read from 75 ms round trip upward, and left the startup
snapshot unable to complete at all at 150 ms — on receive, with no
transmission involved. So the cap lifts for exactly one request once
`kBackgroundStarvationCeilingMs` (1500 ms) has passed with no background
dispatch; that dispatch re-arms both caps, making the admission single-shot
and the background rate a ceiling rather than a share of the link.

1500 ms is where the two pressures stop trading against each other. Over the
same 60 s sustained-TX measurement, worst-case forward-power age is 620/710/
1190 ms at 63/75/100 ms round trip — identical to an unbounded hold at 63 and
75 ms — while control reconciliation still lands roughly 39-45 times a minute
instead of never. A larger ceiling buys no further freshness; the ages
plateau and only background progress is lost. The residual cost is startup on
a slow link: the connect snapshot converges in 46 s at 150 ms round trip
against 13 s with no overdue-meter cap at all — slower, but it converges,
where an uncapped hold never finished it.

Note what this bounds and what it does not: interference by background
requests, not radio reply time. A lost in-flight reply can still consume the
350 ms timeout.

Writes consume the reply slot too: their `FB`/`FA` acknowledgement must be
retired before a later read is sent, or that ACK can be mistaken for the read's
answer. An unsupported read may itself finish with `FB`/`FA`; that releases the
slot but is never decoded as state.

A transaction that outlives its 350 ms timeout, or that a fail-safe unkey
displaces, stays **recognisable for a further two seconds**. The timeout means
"stop waiting", not "this can never arrive": without that memory the identical
frame is rejected as stale at 349 ms and adopted as fresh radio truth at
351 ms, which is enough to put an obsolete reading back over a newer operator
write on every register.

PTT additionally carries an intent generation and a one-second confirmation
window — one second because it must comfortably cover a lost reply (350 ms)
plus the 250 ms fallback poll that follows it, and still expire well inside the
time an operator would take to notice a wrong transmit indicator.

**The window is one-directional, and that asymmetry is the point.** While a
key-*on* intent is pending, a contradictory `RX` report is the delayed pre-key
poll answer and is suppressed: this is RFC #4983's captured FT8 failure, where
treating it as current state tore down transmit audio on a radio that then
keyed normally. While a key-*off* intent is pending, a contradictory `TX`
report is never suppressed — a lost, refused, or front-panel-overridden unkey
is exactly the case where the radio's report is the only thing telling the
operator they are still on the air. RFC #4983 states the rule directly
("explicit PTT OFF and fail-safe unkey are never suppressed by a key-on
transition guard") and Constitution VI requires every path that can transmit to
fail closed. Radio truth wins again as soon as the bounded window expires.

The command edge is therefore **intent only**. `setKeying(true)` neither moves
the backend's keyed state nor publishes `transmitChanged`; only a decoded
`1C 00 01` reply does that. A waveform client such as AetherModem waits for the
radio-confirmed edge before releasing sample zero, with a bounded timeout. This
is load-bearing for short AX.25 frames: the earlier optimistic edge let their
entire preamble run while an IC-705 was still completing its CI-V PTT transition.
The backend advertises this contract as `RadioCapabilities::hasRadioPttReadback`;
`RadioModel` then does not synthesise the command-edge fallback it still uses
for a backend with no status plane.

Three things are deliberately **not** deferred to the readback, because none of
them is a claim about the air. The transmit-audio admission gate
(`txAudioGateOpen`) follows the commanded intent inside its 1 s confirmation
window and radio truth outside it — gating on the readback alone would head-clip
every voice, DAX and TCI over by a CI-V round trip and leave the TUNE carrier
silent until the radio answered. A client unkey still zeroes the derived IC-9700
forward-power estimate immediately. And a readback that **contradicts** a
pending unkey (the radio still keyed) is republished even though the backend's
own keyed flag did not change, so the model's optimistic RX presentation is
corrected rather than left lying (Constitution VI). `icom_ptt_authority_test`
pins all of this without a socket.

| group | interval | condition |
|---|---:|---|
| PTT fallback | 250 ms | connected with an identified CI-V destination; Transceive is only a hint |
| S meter | 100 ms | RX and visible |
| power, SWR, ALC, compression | 200 ms | TX and visible |
| PA current | 500 ms | TX and visible |
| voltage | 1000 ms | visible |
| overflow | 500 ms | RX and visible |
| NR, NB, auto/manual notch state | 1000 ms | connected |
| frequency, mode/DATA, monitor and VOX state | 2000 ms | connected |
| levels, RF power, preamp, AGC, attenuator, RIT/XIT | 3000 ms | connected |
| tuner | 3000 ms | connected and exact profile declares tuner control |

#### State convergence is snapshot + transceive + polling

CI-V Transceive is a useful low-latency hint, not a complete subscription. The
IC-7300MK2 does not reliably announce NR, NB, RF gain, RF power, mic gain,
monitor, VOX, notch, preamp, attenuator, or tuner changes made at the radio.
Reliable remote state therefore has three layers:

1. read every supported state at connect;
2. accept unsolicited Transceive frames when they arrive; and
3. rotate explicit reads on the link timer for states the model guide permits.

Poll slowly enough to leave command latency and meter traffic headroom. The
current intervals are in the table above; priority, coalescing and aging bound
their interaction instead of relying on independent timers to miss each other.
A reply is radio authority and updates the model without reflecting a new
command back down.
Radio-authoritative Icom state must not be replayed from client persistence on
reconnect.

The one measured exception is a write-only-in-practice register such as the
IC-7300MK2 RX-ANT selection: its documented read produced only `FB`. Scope the
send-only control to the model, keep its optimistic state session-local, and
document why it cannot participate in the ordinary polling contract.

#### `DATA OFF MOD` is written; `DATA MOD` is not. Why the two differ

Both are `1A 05` SET-menu leaves the radio persists identically, so the
asymmetry needs stating rather than assuming.

`DATA OFF MOD` selects where **voice** modulation comes from, and PC Audio is
the operator saying "my voice is on this computer" — the two answer the same
question, so a click on that button is a legible request to change it
(Principle II: a user action is a request). `DATA MOD` selects where **data**
modulation comes from, and nothing in AetherSDR's UI expresses an intent about
it: WSJT-X, fldigi and the built-in beacons all reach the radio the same way
whichever source is selected, so a client that wrote it would be changing
operator state on a guess. It stays read-and-report.

Three rules keep the writable half inside Principle III:

1. **Only an operator click writes.** The connect edge *publishes* the client's
   PC Audio state (`icom/audio.pc.state`) so `checkModInput()` can warn about a
   mismatch; the write lives behind `icom/audio.pc`, which nothing but the
   button calls. Replaying the client-persisted `PcAudioEnabled` key onto the
   register at connect is precisely the two-sources-of-truth fight Principle III
   exists to prevent.
2. **"Off" restores, it does not assume.** The register is four-valued on an
   IC-705 and six-valued on an IC-7300MK2; the button has two states. The
   backend latches the radio's own value immediately before its first write of
   the session and puts *that* back, falling back to the profile's `micValue`
   only when there was nothing to capture. Writing a fixed MIC would delete an
   operator's USB or ACC selection with no undo and no dialog.
3. **Unverified models are refused, not guessed at.** `modulationProfileFor()`
   answers only for models whose own CI-V guide has been checked. A click on any
   other Icom is declined and says so; nothing is read, written or shown.

That third rule has a cost worth naming: on a model with no profile, Radio
Health shows no `DATA OFF MOD` / `DATA MOD` row at all, where it used to show
one. The old row read items 118/119 on **every** Icom and labelled the result
from the IC-705's enum — which is how an IC-9700 correctly set to LAN reported
"USB" and got warned at, every session. A row that is wrong is worse than a
missing one; the fix is another verified profile, not a re-enabled guess.

#### A 0000–0255 level is not a 0–255 meter

CI-V `14 xx` levels and `15 xx` meters can both carry values up to 255, but they
have different contracts:

- Percentage controls use the radio front panel's integer buckets. Decode with
  `floor(raw * 100 / 255)` and encode with `ceil(percent * 255 / 100)` so a
  value set in AetherSDR reads back as the same number on the radio. Nearest
  rounding on decode made roughly half the range display one point high.
- Meters use model-specific published curves. Power, SWR, ALC, COMP, Vd, Id,
  and S-meter must never be passed through the percentage helper: ALC reaches
  full scale at raw 120, S9+60 is raw 241, and power curves differ by model.

Keep the percentage conversion in `CivCodec` and meter calibration in
`IcomMeters`. A new model adds or selects curves; it does not fork the control
codec.

#### Transmit meters have a keyed lifetime

Polling a TX meter only while transmitting is necessary but insufficient. The
radio-authoritative `1C 00` state must drive both the poller and the visible
consumer. At startup and idle the forward-power gauge is zero. On unkey it is
cleared immediately, and any late response already in flight is retained only
as diagnostic history — it must not repaint the gauge.

Certification must sample four moments: startup idle, active key, immediate
unkey, and a delayed post-unkey reply. "The backend received a meter" proves
the producer; the visible gauge value proves the product.

#### ATU state is frequency-scoped toggle state

`1C 01` reports bypass/on/tuning, but AetherSDR's successful tune result is also
associated with the frequency that was tuned. Publish current TX frequency in
the same state delta as the tuner reply; otherwise response ordering can leave
the button unable to recognize that `Successful` belongs to the current dial.
Clicking a successful ATU state means bypass (`1C 01 00`) and must not key. A
second click from bypass starts a new tune cycle and is a transmit operation.

### Gap C — the seam's audio contract is 24 kHz stereo, and the radio is 48 kHz mono

Not an Icom problem — a seam fact that is nowhere written down, and that this
backend is the third to have to rediscover.

Everything downstream of `sliceAudioFrameReady` consumes **interleaved stereo
float32 at 24 kHz**. The evidence is spread across three files and no single one
states it:

- `Hl2RxDsp::audioReady(const std::vector<float>& stereoPcm)` — the parameter
  name is the only declaration of channel order.
- `Hl2RxDsp::Config::audioSampleRateHz = 24000` — the only declaration of rate.
- `TciServer::onDaxAudioReady` divides by `2 * sizeof(float)` for the frame
  count and constructs `Resampler(24000.0, cs.audioSampleRate, …)` — the only
  place the two facts appear together, and it is in the consumer.

The Icom delivers **48 kHz mono**, because that is what the RS-BA1 stream
negotiates. So the backend owns a conversion, and **both halves of it are
load-bearing**:

| Skipped | Symptom |
|---|---|
| Rate conversion | Playback runs an octave low. WSJT-X sees every tone at twice its frequency and decodes nothing. |
| Channel duplication | `TciServer` divides by `2 * sizeof(float)` and sees half the frames it has. |

Both failures are **silent** — audio flows, meters move, the session is healthy.
The retired `icom_backend_test` fake-radio fixture asserted the ratio (4800 mono
samples in at 48 kHz → ~2400 stereo frames out at 24 kHz) rather than merely
asserting that audio arrived. The resampler half stays covered by the retained
`tx_mic_channel_normalizer_test`; the backend-level negative passthrough
assertion (a backend that skips the conversion emits ~4800 frames) awaits a
socket-free injected replacement (#5254) — live validation cannot prove that
non-event.

`Resampler::processMonoToStereo` does both halves in one call. It is stateful
(r8brain), so the instance is built once at connect — a fresh one per callback
restarts the filter history every block, which is audible as a periodic tick.

**One TCI channel, and that is the whole requirement for WSJT-X.** Slice 0 →
DAX channel 1 → TRX 0, via the existing `MainWindow_Session` wiring
(`onDaxAudioReady(sliceId + 1, pcm)`). Nothing Icom-specific is needed in
`TciServer`; the backend only has to emit the right bytes and publish a slice
for the routing to resolve against.

### Gap D — the scope is not calibrated

`spectrumFrameReady` carries float dBm on the HL2 path. The Icom scope is 0–160
display units relative to the `27 19` reference level, and Icom publishes no
calibration.

Follow the `Hl2DbReference` precedent: a named per-model offset, documented as an
estimate, anchored to the reference level read back from the radio, and
cross-checked against the **S-meter**, which *is* calibrated (0 = S0, 120 = S9,
241 = S9+60 dB). Put a known signal in the passband and compare.

Until that cross-check exists, the UI should not present the scope's Y axis as
absolute dBm. An honest relative scale beats a number that looks like a
measurement and is not.

## 6. Transport and codec commonality across models

Recorded because it is the question that decides whether "add a model" means a
table row or a second backend, and because the answer rests on inference rather
than on any specification.

### The UDP transport is the same protocol on every networked Icom

Four independent checks, all agreeing:

- **wfview has zero per-model branching in its UDP path.** `icomudpbase`,
  `icomudphandler`, `icomudpaudio` and `icomudpcivdata` contain no `modelID`
  test, no CI-V-address special case, and no mention of any model name. One
  implementation drives the IC-705, IC-9700, IC-7610, IC-785x and IC-7300MK2.
- **kappanhang** lists IC-705, IC-9700, IC-7610 and IC-785x as compatible with a
  single codebase.
- **The IC-7300MK2's own CI-V guide exposes the same three-port structure** —
  `1A 05 01 10 / 11 / 12` are Control Port (UDP), Serial Port (UDP) and Audio
  Port (UDP), alongside Network Control (`01 08`) and an Internet Access Line
  setting (`01 13`, FTTH / ADSL-CATV). That FTTH value is the same string the
  IC-705 returns in its login reply at offset `0x40`.
- **The scope division split is identical**: `01` over LAN, `11` over USB.

So `IcomStream` and `IcomSession` are expected to work against any of them
unchanged, and per-model variation is confined to `IcomModels`. **This is an
inference from convergent implementations plus a matching feature surface, not
a documented guarantee** — Icom documents the transport nowhere, for any model.
Treat a new model's first connection as a test of this claim.

### The codec negotiation is shared; codec ACCEPTANCE is unverified per model

The mechanism is unambiguously transport-level, not model-level: the client
chooses the codec in the conninfo packet (`0x72` / `0x73`, sample rate at `0x74`
/ `0x78`). Nothing about that is per-radio.

What is **not** established is which codecs a given radio accepts. Neither the
IC-705 nor the IC-7300MK2 CI-V guide mentions "codec" even once, and wfview
offers its full nine-entry codec list to every radio unconditionally — which
tells us wfview does not model per-radio codec support, not that every radio
supports all nine.

LPCM 1ch 16-bit at 48 kHz is what we negotiate, what kappanhang uses
exclusively, and what wfview defaults to. It is the safe common denominator and
should stay the default for any newly added model until someone proves
otherwise on that radio.

### Nothing here is an "air" protocol

Worth stating once because the phrasing recurs: all of the above is the LAN /
WiFi link. The over-the-air side — SSB, CW, FM modulation — happens entirely
inside the radio. With no IQ on any networked Icom, this backend never handles
anything airborne; it ships demodulated audio and receives a cooked spectrum.

---

## 7. Phasing

Each phase is independently shippable and independently provable.

**Phase 0 — the socket.** `IcomStream` + `IcomSession`: handshake, login, token
renewal, keepalives, ARQ. No CI-V, no audio. Proof: connects to an IC-705, stays
connected for an hour, `linkStats` shows RTT and zero loss. This is the phase
where the protocol is either right or wrong, and it is testable against a
recorded packet trace with no radio attached.

**Phase 1 — control.** `CivCodec` + the command table: frequency, mode, filter,
PTT, power. Proof: the automation bridge tunes the radio and reads it back; the
front panel follows. This is the phase that makes the backend *useful*.

**Phase 2 — panadapter.** `IcomScope`: enable `27 10` **and** `27 11`, decode the
single-packet WLAN waveform, emit spectrum and waterfall. Proof: a screenshot
with a real signal at a known frequency landing in the right bin.

**Phase 3 — audio.** `IcomAudio`: codec 4 LPCM 48 k mono, RX first. Then TX,
which needs the model's network source in DATA MOD (WLAN on IC-705, LAN on
IC-7300MK2) and **verification outside the system** —
a second receiver or a WebSDR, per `feedback-verify-outside-the-system`. A TX
path that looks perfect from inside AetherSDR and is silent on the air is the
exact failure mode this project has already been bitten by.

**Phase 4 — meters and health.** `IcomMeters`: the published calibration curves
plus a poll scheduler with four rules (visible-only, TX/RX split, one request in
flight, yield to user commands). The scheduler takes an injected clock so the
policy is provable in microseconds rather than by watching a radio. Proof on
hardware later: S-meter against a signal generator, Po against a wattmeter into
a dummy load.

**Phase 5 — breadth.** Model discovery via `19 00` and a per-model capability
table keyed by CI-V address. Only the IC-705 row is `verified`; every other row
says so, and the unknown-model fallback is deliberately conservative (no scope,
no transmit) because an unrecognised radio advertised as scope-capable wires a
panadapter to a command it may not implement.

**CI-V over a local serial port is DEFERRED, not cancelled.** It brings in every
non-networked Icom (IC-7300 and up) and is the strongest argument for the
`IcomCIV` name, which is why `CivCodec` is already transport-free — the increment
is a transport class, not a rewrite.

---

## 8. Clean-room provenance

**wfview is GPL-3.0 and AetherSDR cannot take code from it.** It is the best
reference available and it must be treated as a *specification*: read it, cite
it, do not paste it. This is the same rule the project already applies to
`pihpsdr` for the HL2 test fixture.

**kappanhang is MIT** and is the reference to port *from*, with attribution.

**Hamlib is LGPL-2.1.** Its meter calibration tables are data, but most of the
same curves are in Icom's own published guide — derive them from tier 1 and the
question does not arise.

Allowed inputs, in order: Icom's CI-V Reference Guides (facts, not text);
kappanhang (MIT, portable); wfview and Hamlib (read-only reference); packet
captures from our own radio.

---

## 9. Explicitly out of scope for phase 1

- **IQ.** It does not exist on this radio. Not deferred — absent.
- **Writing radio memory channels.** All Icom radios use AetherSDR's shared,
  writable memory database as the working model. For IC-705, IC-7300MK2, and
  IC-9700, **Sync Memories** reads the model-specific ordinary-channel records
  with `1A 00` and ingests occupied channels into that database; Tune then
  recalls the durable database row like a manual or CSV-imported memory.
  Imported rows are keyed by the 16-byte radio GUID from the authenticated
  RS-BA1 capabilities record plus the native group/channel, so DHCP, mDNS and
  NAT endpoint changes cannot duplicate a radio's channel set. Repeat Sync
  refreshes tuning fields while preserving the name, owner and group assigned
  at first import or edited locally. Clearing a native channel removes its
  matching imported row. Split/RPS/DV/DD records remain display-only.
  Existing experimental imports with incorrect recallability need one explicit
  Sync: they did not retain enough split metadata for a safe load-time repair.
  Loading an existing bank never rewrites it. Ordinary local memories remain
  schema 1; saves containing native recall fields use schema 2 so an older
  writer cannot erase recallability, DTCS state or provenance. Downgrading
  after such a save requires a compatible build or a pre-Sync settings backup.
  Reads are button-only; IC-705 requires a selected native group so a click queues 100
  requests rather than scanning its 10,000-address space. Flex global/TX
  profiles are not valid Icom group selectors. Writing or deleting the radio's
  own channels, plus scan-edge, call, and satellite memories, remain deferred.
  Other Icom models still use the same client-side database, but expose no Sync
  action until their published record layout is implemented and verified.
- **D-STAR / DV.** A large command surface (`22 xx`, `23 xx`) and a separate
  feature.
- **Bluetooth transport.** Unknown whether it carries all three streams.
- **Opus and ADPCM codecs.** LPCM first. They matter for WAN use, so this is a
  deferral rather than a dismissal.
- **USB transport.** Needs the 11-chunk scope reassembly the WLAN path avoids
  (implemented in `ScopeDecoder` already; the transport is what is missing).
- **Local serial CI-V.** Deferred, not cancelled — `CivCodec` is transport-free
  precisely so this stays a transport class rather than a rewrite. It brings in
  every non-networked Icom, the original IC-7300 included.
- **Reading the radio's UDP ports over CI-V**, and **remote power-on**. Both are
  IC-7300MK2 capabilities the IC-705 does not have. See §11.

Multi-model support is no longer on this list: `19 00` discovery and the
capability table are built, with the IC-705 and IC-7300MK2 both verified against
their own Icom CI-V guides.

---

## 10. Open questions needing a radio on the bench

Carried from oracle §12, because they gate specific phases:

1. **Scope frame rate over WLAN** — gates whether `setPanFrameRate` does anything.
2. **Does the scope update during TX?** — gates the phase-2/3 interaction.
3. **The real dBm offset**, per band and preamp setting — gates Gap C.
4. **Are `27 15` span changes echoed** when set on the front panel, or must they
   be polled? — gates whether the pan follows the operator's own zoom.
5. **Second-client behaviour.** The protocol has `busy` and `computer` fields;
   the IC-705's single-session response to contention is untested.
6. **Does an IC-7300MK2 answer on the LAN while in Standby?** This single
   question gates the remote power-on feature in §11 — and it is the one whose
   wrong answer is expensive, because a radio that shuts its interface down
   cannot be woken and has to be reached physically.

Answering 1–4 needs perhaps an hour with the radio and a packet capture, and
would remove most of the guesswork from phases 2 and 3. Question 6 needs an
MK2, which is a different radio from the one the rest of this targets.

---

## 11. Roadmap candidates

Not built, deliberately. Each is recorded here with what it needs so the
decision is not re-litigated from scratch.

### Complete the IC-9700 bring-up

The IC-9700 is not an unknown radio: its network session, 475-bin scope geometry
and `26 00` VFO/mode reply have been observed live, its three disjoint RF decks
and PA ceilings are modeled, and its profile carries official-guide plus PR
#5149 live-wire evidence for the repeater and XFC command families. That does
not make the remaining selected-receiver UX and transmit bring-up complete.

The next bench pass should, in order:

1. repeat this increment's complete TONE enable/frequency,
   duplex `+`/`-`/simplex, offset and held-XFC operator workflow from both
   AetherSDR and the front panel;
2. recall a local memory and confirm the final radio state, not only the UX;
3. establish whether CI-V addresses repeater state per selected receiver or can
   independently name MAIN and SUB, then keep the current selected-receiver
   model or add a neutral receiver selector from evidence;
4. verify the model-specific mode/filter, preamp/attenuator and meter tables
   against the guide and hardware; and
5. run the ordinary transmit safety sweep separately on 144, 430 and 1200 MHz,
   with the correct dummy-load path and per-band power ceiling.

Do not infer dual-receiver ownership from `maxSlices = 2`. The radio can receive
on MAIN and SUB simultaneously; the current backend publishes a selected-radio
state surface, and converting that into two independently authoritative slices
is a separate seam and routing decision.

### Read the radio's UDP ports over CI-V (IC-7300MK2 and later)

Today the backend assumes 50001 / 50002 / 50003 and, when the operator has
changed them, fails with a timeout that names the wrong cause — "no answer from
the radio" is indistinguishable from Network Control being off.

The MK2 exposes them: `1A 05 01 10` (Control), `01 11` (Serial), `01 12` (Audio),
each a three-byte BCD value covering 1–65535. `01 08` reads Network Control
itself, so a connected client could also report *definitively* that it is
disabled rather than guessing.

The catch is ordering: those are CI-V commands, and CI-V arrives over the serial
stream, which cannot open until the control stream's request has already
announced the ports. So this cannot bootstrap a first connection. What it can do
is **confirm and cache** them once connected, so a later reconnect uses the real
values and a mismatch is reported precisely. That is worth having and is a
smaller feature than it first looks.

**The IC-705 does not expose these at all** — they are menu-only there. So this
is per-model, gated on `IcomModel`, and another reason the capability table
earns its place.

### Remote power-on / reboot (IC-7300MK2)

`capabilities().canReboot` is currently **false for every model**, on the
reasoning that `18 00` powers the radio off, which drops the network interface,
so the `18 01` that would bring it back has no path. That reasoning is sound for
the IC-705 on WiFi and **may be too conservative for the MK2**.

The MK2 has `1A 05 01 09` — "Power OFF Setting (for Remote Control)": `00` = Only
Shutdown, `01` = Standby/Shutdown. And the IC-705's guide already documents that
`18 01` "turns ON the transceiver when the transceiver is OFF
(Standby/Shutdown)". A mains-powered radio with an Ethernet port plausibly keeps
its LAN interface alive in Standby, which is exactly the condition that makes
remote power-on work.

**Unverified, and the failure mode is bad**: a reboot the operator cannot
recover from strands the radio until someone walks to it. So this needs a bench
answer to one question — *does the MK2 answer on the LAN while in Standby?* —
before `canReboot` becomes true for it. If it does, the feature is
`setPowerOffMode(Standby)` plus a guarded `18 00` / `18 01` pair, and the
capability stays per-model.

### Close the gaps `controls map` now names

The registry in `IcomControls.h` and the `controls` bridge verb turned the
coverage audit below from a document somebody has to maintain into something the
running backend answers for itself. Three gaps it names are real work, and they
are listed here rather than fixed in the same breath because each is a different
size:

**`14 01` AF gain is decode-only.** It is read at connect and decoded into
`SliceDelta::audioGain`, but `IcomCivBackend` does not override
`setSliceAudioGain`, so the operator's AF slider moves, persists, and reaches no
register. The smallest of the three: one override, one `cmdSetLevel`. The reason
it stayed hidden is exactly the reason the registry exists — a control that is
half-wired renders identically to one that works.

**`16 45` TX monitor and `16 46` VOX are asked for and thrown away.** Both are in
the connect-time function read loop, both replies arrive, and the `0x16` decode
switch has no case for either, so they fall through `default:` and are dropped.
The monitor button therefore opens at OUR default on a radio that may have the
monitor on; VOX cannot be set at all, so its read is pure cost. Two decode cases
and, for VOX, a seam verb that does not exist yet.

**Five constants have no code path at all** — `14 09` CW pitch, `14 0C` keyer
speed, `16 47` break-in, `16 57` manual-notch width, and
`27 1E` scope fixed edges. Not all of them should be wired: the notch width
is deliberately left to the operator's own choice, and the fixed edges are three
saved presets per band that a pan drag must never overwrite. CW pitch is the one
that costs something today — it decides where a CW filter sits, so the passband
drawn in CW assumes the radio's default rather than reading it.

`1C 02` XFC is no longer in that list for profiles that attest it. The IC-705,
IC-7300MK2 and IC-9700 profiles expose it as a momentary transmit-frequency
check, so both repeater-control surfaces send ON while held and OFF on release,
follow radio readback, and poll the state when CI-V Transceive does not announce
a front-panel edge.

**RIT and XIT are send-only.** `21 00/01/02` are written and never read, so the
controls open at our defaults rather than the radio's. Unlike the above this is
a *reconnect* problem, not a dead control: the operator sets RIT, reconnects, and
the app shows zero on a radio that is still offset.

### Triage a connection hang by its last command

`controls meters` reports each meter's age and `civ trace` reports the last
frames, and together they diagnosed a stall during this bring-up in about a
minute: every meter frozen at the same instant, the newest frame a minute old, a
freshly sent command unanswered — and `isConnected()` still returning true.

The cause there was self-inflicted (repeated hard kills of the app leave an
IC-705 holding a stale session, and it ignores the next one), but the *shape* is
what matters: **the session reported healthy while the command plane had been
dead for 87 seconds.** `IcomSession` already tracks link statistics; what it does
not do is notice that nothing has come back. See `m_lastInboundAtMs` and the
`civStall` warning added alongside this — the next hang should say which command
was in flight when the radio stopped answering, rather than requiring an operator
to notice the S-meter is not moving.

### Audio transport: what we mirror from kappanhang, and why

The transmit path is modelled on **kappanhang**, not on wfview's remote-client
model. Both speak the same protocol, but wfview also implements its own SERVER,
and several of its options only work against that server rather than against a
radio. Measured against an IC-705:

| Parameter | kappanhang | AetherSDR |
|---|---|---|
| sample rate | 48000, fixed | 48000, fixed |
| sample width | s16 mono | s16 mono |
| frame duration | 20 ms | 20 ms |
| frame bytes | **derived** — rate x bytes x duration | **derived** (was a bare `1920`) |
| packet split | 1364 + 556 | 1364 + 556 |
| `txbuffer` (0x84) | **300 ms** | **300 ms** (was 200) |
| RX reorder hold | 100 ms | 100 ms |
| audio-stream pkt0 idles | **none** | **none** (was 100 ms) |
| codec | LPCM 1ch 16-bit only | LPCM 1ch 16-bit only |

**The 1364/556 split is MTU fragmentation, not a protocol rule.** wfview chunks
whatever buffer it is handed into 1364-byte pieces in a loop; the famous pair is
just what a 1920-byte frame becomes. kappanhang hardcodes the same two offsets.
Either way the invariant is the frame's **duration**, and the byte count follows
from the rate and the sample width.

The transmit queue is clocked at **one 20 ms frame pair per 20 ms**, drained by
elapsed time: a late or coalesced timer tick sends the frames it owes (at most
three per tick), so backlog cannot ratchet, while an on-time tick sends exactly
one. A producer may front-load audio to absorb GUI scheduling jitter, and that
queue depth never turns into a wire burst — but neither can it grow without
bound, which is what "exactly one per tick" did: a Qt timer only ever fires
late, so producer and consumer ran at equal rate with no recovery until the
packetizer's 250 ms cap shed the oldest audio mid-over. That pump clocks every
Icom transmission, voice included. At scheduled packet completion the backend
reports what is **actually** still queued — the padded host queue at wire cadence
plus the negotiated 300 ms radio buffer — and AetherModem holds PTT for that plus
its ordinary tail; an operator/manual unkey remains immediate and never takes
that delay.

Finite modem audio has an additional completion barrier. The engine posts it
behind the final PCM block, and `IcomCivBackend` then drains the 24-to-48 kHz
resampler before AetherModem starts the unkey timer. r8brain's prewarm removes
its no-output startup interval, not its linear-phase group delay; without the
drain, a captured packet kept roughly 70 ms of silence at its front and lost
roughly 70 ms from its end — enough to remove AX.25 FCS plus postamble. The
drained samples are queued while PTT is still radio-confirmed, and the remaining
partial 20 ms transport frame is padded with codec-correct silence.

**THE RATE CANNOT MOVE ON ITS OWN.** `kAudioFrameBytes` was the constant 1920,
which is 20 ms only at 48 kHz s16. Lowering the rate to 16 kHz while leaving it
alone produced 60 ms frames: the radio's jitter buffer read them as
discontinuities and discarded every one. Measured — a keyed transmitter, zero
forward power for a full 20 s, nothing audible on a receiver beside the radio,
and no trace on the radio's own panadapter, while CI-V stayed healthy at 255 ms
meter ages. The frame size is now derived and a `static_assert` guards the
split, so the next attempt fails at build time instead of on the air.

**Opus and ADPCM do not work on this radio.** They are the obvious answer to a
weak link and they are not available: wfview force-downgrades any codec >= 0x40
to LPCM16 unless the peer's login response reports connection type `WFVIEW` —
i.e. another wfview server. kappanhang never implements them at all. The codec
table in the oracle lists what the protocol FIELD can carry and what wfview's UI
offers; it is not a statement about the hardware.

That leaves sample rate, sample width (uLaw 8-bit halves it) and nothing else as
real bandwidth levers on an IC-705 — and every one of them needs the derived
framing above before it can be offered safely. **`LowBandwidthConnect` therefore
still does nothing on this family, deliberately.**

#### Confirmed by ear, 2026-08-06

Operator report on the aligned build, IC-705 on 7.200 MHz into a 10 W dummy
load, monitored on a Kenwood TH-D75 beside the radio:

- **TUNE tone: no break-ups.** This also settles an open question — `setTune`
  synthesises its carrier into the same transmit audio path, so a clean tune
  tone is direct evidence that path is healthy rather than merely quiet.
- **Voice: legible on the Kenwood.** An unrelated receiver again, which is the
  only check that shares none of our code.

Before the change the same operator saw cutouts of one to two seconds and
watched the meters bounce through them.

**Which of the three changes did it is NOT established.** Deriving the frame
size from duration is a NO-OP at 48 kHz s16 — it still computes 1920 — so it
cannot be responsible; it is correctness insurance for any future rate change,
not a fix for this. That leaves `txbuffer` 200 -> 300 ms and dropping the tracked
pkt0 idles from the audio stream, and the two were changed together. If the
question ever matters, they can be separated: each is a one-line revert.

#### FT8 decodes, 2026-08-06 — the RX transport certified by machine

Operator ran FT8 against the IC-705 on the aligned build and **got decodes**.

This is the strongest evidence the audio work has produced, and stronger than
the voice check, because a decoder is not a listener being charitable. FT8 is
unforgiving in exactly the places this transport was suspect:

- **Sample rate must be genuinely 48 kHz**, not approximately. A rate error
  shifts every decoded tone and misaligns the 15-second window.
- **Continuity must hold across a full 15 s.** The one-to-two-second cutouts
  seen before the change would have punched holes through decode windows.

A decode is therefore a per-window assertion that the receive path was coherent
for fifteen unbroken seconds — a stimulus we could not have built by hand.

**Scope: this certifies RX only.** Transmitting FT8 is a separate claim — the TX
audio path plus timing accuracy on the keying edge — and is not established by
a decode. A spot on PSK Reporter would establish it.

### Resolved: transmit meter polling and visible lifetime

The earlier failure was real: `TX:FWDPWR` / `TX:SWR` / `TX:ALC` could stop being
refreshed while the CI-V stream remained healthy. The poller was gated by a TX
state inferred too narrowly from our own keying path or a missed unsolicited
edge. The backend now polls `1C 00`, and radio-authoritative MOX updates drive
both `TransmitModel::transmitting` and the meter poller.

The IC-7300MK2 pass exposed the inverse failure after that fix: the last live
forward-power sample remained visible after unkey. The model may retain it for
diagnostics, but `TxApplet` now presents power only while transmitting, clears
immediately on unkey, and ignores a late response that was already in flight.
Live validation left a 16 W sample in the backend after an emergency unkey while
the visible gauge correctly read zero.

**Harness rule:** require both a fresh age and an active radio-authoritative TX
window. Sample startup idle, active key, immediate unkey, and delayed idle. A
stale non-zero value is not power, and a fresh reply after unkey is not current
power either.

## Appendix C — CI-V coverage audit

Every meter and switch in the IC-705 and IC-7300MK2 CI-V guides, against what
this backend maps and what the UI actually consumes. Written after live testing
found five "broken" meters that were all publishing correctly at the seam.

> **RESOLVED, 2026-08-06.** The two unit-contract defects called out below are
> fixed and verified in `MeterModel`: `m_fwdPwrUnit` is honoured (`"Watts"`
> skips the dBm conversion) and `m_swAlcUnit` is honoured (`"Percent"` maps onto
> the dBFS gauge). The prose is kept because the *shape* of the defect is the
> lesson, not its instance — a `unit` field that is carried, displayed and then
> ignored by the consumer that matters. Both are now certified on live Icom
> hardware; see the certification report for model-specific evidence.

**The dominant defect was not a missing mapping — it was a UNIT CONTRACT.**
`MeterModel` interpreted a meter by name with a unit it assumed rather than the
one declared. `TX:FWDPWR` in watts was converted as dBm, and `TX:ALC` percent was
rendered on a dBFS gauge. The consumer now honours `MeterDef::unit`. Keep this
history because a backend can publish an honest value and still be wrong on
screen; certification has to inspect the consumer, not stop at the seam.

### C.1 Meters (`15 xx`)

| CI-V | Guide semantics | Mapped | Published as | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `15 01` | Noise/S-meter squelch open | `kSquelchStatus` | — | constant defined, never polled |
| `15 02` | S-meter, 0=S0 / 120=S9 / 241=S9+60 | ✅ | `SLC:LEVEL` dBm | **working** |
| `15 05` | Various squelch (tone etc.) open | ✗ | — | unmapped |
| `15 07` | ADC OVF indicator | `kOverflow` | `RAD:OVF` Percent | published, no consumer |
| `15 11` | Po, 0=0% / 143=50% / 213=100% | ✅ | `TX:FWDPWR` **Watts** | **working** — model-specific curve; visible only while keyed |
| `15 12` | SWR, 0=1.0 / 48=1.5 / 80=2.0 / 120=3.0 | ✅ | `TX:SWR` SWR | **working** — transmit-only; clears on unkey |
| `15 13` | ALC, 0=min / 120=max | ✅ | `TX:ALC` **Percent** | **working** — consumer honours Percent |
| `15 14` | COMP meter, 0=0 dB / 130=15 dB / 210=25.5 dB | ✅ | `TX:COMPPEAK` dB | working while transmitting; independent of the `16 44` / `14 0E` compressor controls |
| `15 15` | Vd, 0=0 V / 75=5 V / 241=16 V | ✅ | `RAD:+13.8A` Volts | **working** |
| `15 16` | Id, 0=0 A / 121=2 A / 241=4 A | ✅ | `RAD:PACURRENT` Amps | published, no consumer |

**There is no mic-level meter and no temperature meter in the CI-V set.** The
list above is complete. So the Phone/CW **Level** gauge (mic peak, dBFS) and
`TX:MICPEAK` can never move on this radio, and neither can `RAD:PATEMP`. Both
want hiding on a backend that owns its own microphone, not fixing.

### C.2 Functions (`16 xx`) — switches

| CI-V | Function | Mapped | Reaches a control |
|---|---|---|---|
| `16 02` | Preamp OFF/P.AMP1/P.AMP2 | ✅ | ✅ via `setPanRfGain` |
| `16 12` | AGC FAST/MID/SLOW | ✅ | ✅ via `setSliceAgc` |
| `16 22` | Noise blanker | ✅ | ✗ constant only |
| `16 40` | Noise reduction | ✅ | ✗ constant only |
| `16 41` | Auto notch | ✅ | ✗ constant only |
| `16 42` | Repeater tone (TONE) | ✅ | ✅ live-verified on IC-705; connect readback + front-panel adoption |
| `16 43` | Tone squelch (TSQL) | ✗ | ✗ — separate from the mapped repeater TONE control |
| `16 44` | **Speech compressor enable** | ✅ | ✅ via `setSpeechProcessor`; connect readback and confirmation adopt radio state |
| `16 45` | Monitor | ✅ | ✗ constant only |
| `16 46` | VOX | ✅ | ✗ constant only |
| `16 47` | BK-IN OFF/SEMI/FULL | ✗ | ✗ **CW break-in unreachable** |
| `16 48` | Manual notch | ✅ | ✗ constant only |
| `16 4F` | Twin peak filter (RTTY) | ✗ | ✗ |
| `16 50` | Dial lock | ✅ | ✅ IC-705/IC-7300MK2/IC-9700 profile-gated read/write + polling |
| `16 56` | DSP IF filter SHARP/SOFT | ✗ | ✗ |
| `16 57` | Manual notch width W/M/N | ✗ | ✗ |
| `16 58` | SSB TX bandwidth W/M/N | ✗ | ✗ |

### C.3 Levels (`14 xx`)

Mapped: AF `01`, RF `02`, squelch `03`, NR `06`, CW pitch `09`, RF power `0A`,
mic gain `0B`, key speed `0C`, COMP level `0E`, NB level `12`, monitor `15`.

Unmapped: notch position `0D`, break-in delay `0F`, VOX gain `16`, anti-VOX
gain `17`.

**`14 0E` is the missing half of speech compression.** The enable and level are
two commands on Icom, not one. Legacy profiles retain the shared PROC preset
surface; a model profile may expose an evidenced continuous COMP level:
`16 44` controls on/off and `14 0E` (0000–0255 ⇒ 0–10) is the level register.
Legacy profiles map that register to the three shared PROC presets; the IC-9700
profile maps it bidirectionally to the continuous 0–100 COMP percentage.

### C.4 RIT / XIT (`21 xx`) — entirely unmapped

| CI-V | Function | Mapped |
|---|---|---|
| `21 00` | RIT frequency | ✗ |
| `21 01` | RIT ON/OFF | ✗ |
| `21 02` | ∂TX (XIT) ON/OFF | ✗ |

No constant, no builder, no call site. RIT and XIT are not wired in at all.

### C.5 IF filter — three, not more

The radio has exactly **FIL1 / FIL2 / FIL3**, selected in the mode command's
third byte. `filterForWidthHz()` snaps a width request onto them correctly, but
the UI still offers the full Flex step list, so most of its steps land on the
same three filters. The reachable set is a capability the backend should
publish, the same way the RF-gain control was narrowed to three preamp detents.

---

## Appendix D — Applet control inventory

Which controls on the surfaces the operator uses actually reach this radio.

**Method.** Two passes. The first traced wiring from source — a control is
"linked" when its intent reaches an `IRadioBackend` verb this backend overrides.
The second DROVE the controls against a live IC-705 and read the resulting CI-V
frames back through `civ trace`, checking each encoded value against arithmetic
rather than against an observed capture. The 2026-08-13 IC-7300MK2 pass extends
the same shared command paths; model-specific exceptions are called out below.

Rows marked ✅ **verified** were driven and their bytes checked. Rows marked
✅ implemented were traced but never driven — treat those exactly as the first
pass intended: the map of what CAN work, not evidence that it does.

### D.1 The structural finding — FIXED

**Most receive-DSP controls did not use the seam at all.** `SliceModel::setNr`,
`setAnf`, `setNb` and `setSquelch` emitted FlexRadio wire text:

```cpp
void SliceModel::setNr(bool on) {
    m_nr = on;
    sendCommand(QString("slice set %1 nr=%2").arg(m_id).arg(on ? 1 : 0));
}
```

On a Flex that string is the command. On every other backend it is discarded —
there is no `IRadioBackend` verb for any of them, so no backend can implement
one however much it wants to. The control moves, the model updates, the UI
agrees with itself, and the radio never hears about it.

This is the same shape as lesson 1.5 (the bridge is not the UI) one layer down,
and it was why `hasRadioSideDsp = true` bought nothing: the capability said the
radio's own firmware runs NR/NB/notch while the intents to drive them had
nowhere to go.

**Resolved.** `setSliceNoiseReduction` / `NoiseBlanker` / `AutoNotch` / `Squelch`
now exist on the seam, `SliceModel` emits operator-intent signals alongside the
Flex wire text (so Flex is unchanged), and `RadioModel` routes them for any
non-Flex backend. The audio setters (`setSliceAudioGain` / `Mute` / `Pan`) have
verbs and this backend still does not implement them.

Two enabling changes came out of trying to TEST this, and both are lessons in
their own right (CERTIFICATION.md §1.29):

* the RX applet's DSP toggles have no `objectName` and no `accessibleName`, so
  `invoke()` cannot address them — hence the `slice dsp` bridge verb;
* `nr2_toggle` cycles off → NR → NR2 → NR4 through the HOST chain and can fail
  to reach the slice at all, so the one shortcut that names NR is not a reliable
  way to drive it.

### D.2 By surface

| Surface | Control | State |
|---|---|---|
| **VFO / slice flag** | frequency | ✅ `setSliceFrequency` |
| | mode + IF filter | ✅ **verified** — `06 03 01` (CW, FIL1) |
| | S-meter flag | ✅ `SLC:LEVEL` |
| | RIT | ✅ **verified** — `21 01 01` then `21 00 00 00 00` |
| | XIT | ✅ implemented (`21 02`); shares ONE offset register with RIT |
| **S-meter applet** | level display | ✅ |
| **RX Controls** | AGC mode | ✅ `setSliceAgc` (FAST/MID/SLOW) |
| | AGC threshold | ❌ accepted and discarded — the radio has no threshold register |
| | RF gain | ✅ `setPanRfGain` → continuous `14 02`; polled for front-panel changes |
| | preamp / attenuator | ✅ discrete `16 02` / `11`; separate from RF gain |
| | filter width | ✅ snaps to FIL1/2/3, and the three are now published as `rxFilterWidthsHz` so the applet stops offering widths that all land on the same filter. Capability wiring is code-verified; the three buttons have NOT been confirmed on screen |
| | NR | ✅ **verified** — `16 40 01` + `14 06 01 53` (60 % = 153) |

| | ANF | ✅ **verified** — `16 41 01` |
| | squelch | ✅ **verified** — `14 03 01 02` (40 % = 102). No enable exists: the threshold IS the control and off is zero |

| | TX filter | ❌ `setTxFilter` not implemented (`16 58` unmapped) |
| **Phone / CW** | profile-shaped PROC/COMP enable + level | ✅ `setSpeechProcessor` (`16 44` + `14 0E`) |
| | ALC / Compression gauges | ✅ (ALC scale fixed; unverified) |
| | Level gauge | ⛔ hidden — this radio publishes no mic meter |
| | mic source | ✅ collapsed to PC by capability |
| | mic gain | ✅ `setMicGain` (`14 0B`), read at connect and polled |
| | monitor | ✅ `setTxMonitor` (`16 45` + `14 15`), both switch and level read back |
| | VOX | ✅ `setVox` (`16 46` + `14 16`), both switch and level read back |
| | CW speed / pitch / break-in | ❌ no seam verb (`14 0C`, `14 09` mapped; `16 47` unmapped) |
| **Status bar** | voltage | ✅ `RAD:+13.8A` |
| | temperature / current | IC-705: no temperature; IC-7300MK2: `Id` from `15 16` while transmitting |
| | radio nickname / model | ✅ **verified on IC-705** — Network Radio Name from the RS-BA1 handshake; canonical model from `19 00` |
| | network hostname | ⚠️ shows the connect address; no separate host alias is published |

### D.3 One control, two registers

NR and NB are single switches here and two registers on the radio, so the intent
carries enable and level together. Driving "NR on at level 60" first produced
`16 40 00` immediately before `16 40 01` — a brief disable of the operator's
noise reduction, from two individually-correct commands in the wrong order.

The backend now sends a function command only when the state actually changes,
and forgets what it believes on disconnect: the radio keeps its own DSP state
across our sessions and we never read it back, so carrying the previous
session's belief would suppress the first command that matters. Recorded as
CERTIFICATION.md §1.31 because it generalises to any fanned-out control.

### D.4 What is left

**Not implemented**

1. **Audio gain / mute / pan** — seam verbs exist, no override here. The radio's
   AF level IS now read at connect, so the control opens in the right place and
   then cannot move it, which is arguably worse than not reading it.
2. **CW speed / pitch / break-in** — CI-V mapped or trivially mappable; no seam
   verb yet.
3. **TX filter** (`16 58` SSB TX bandwidth) — `setTxFilter` exists, unimplemented.
4. **AGC threshold** is accepted and discarded; the radio has no threshold
   register. Better to advertise it as unavailable than keep a live slider that
   does nothing.

**Implemented and NOT proven on hardware** — the distinction this appendix
exists to keep visible:

5. **The backend-owned TUNE cadence.** Synthesised and built, with fresh
   IC-705 and IC-7300MK2 hardware revalidation pending; it never invokes the
   antenna tuner command.
6. **Mic gain and TX monitor on IC-705.** The shared paths are live-proven on
   IC-7300MK2; an IC-705 UI/effect pass is still outstanding.
7. **The three filter buttons**, on screen with the applet open.
8. **Connect-time state adoption**, beyond confirming the values arrive: whether
   each one lands on the control an operator is looking at is a separate
   question, and it is the §1.27 gap in a different costume.
9. **XIT.** RIT was driven and observed on the wire; XIT shares the offset
   register and was not.
10. **IC-9700 selected-receiver repeater/XFC UX.** The shared command families
    have official and live-wire evidence through PR #5149; this increment's
    basic control surface and MAIN/SUB ownership still need a complete operator
    pass on that radio.

**Open defects**

11. **Transmit cuts out roughly once a second on FT8** — see CERTIFICATION.md
    §2.6. The radio stays keyed and ALC stays active, so this is not a keying
    or an audio-delivery fault; what remains is real RF pulsing or a low-drive
    meter artefact, and those want a higher-power run to separate.
12. **A revoked session still looks healthy.** The backend swallows a post-grant
    auth failure as "the previous session's teardown" — right for a reconnect,
    wrong when the radio really has withdrawn this one. It should disconnect.

## Appendix E — CI-V capability sweep, observed on the wire

A black-box read-only sweep of an IC-705 (firmware E1.40), driven through
`civ send` / `civ trace`. Raw results: [`docs/data/icom-ic705-civ-sweep.json`];
the sweeper is `tools/icom_civ_sweep.py`.

**Provenance.** Every fact below is a response this radio gave to a command we
sent. Nothing here is derived from a firmware image, and it must stay that way —
Principle IV is explicit that decompiled protocol *knowledge* contaminates
everything written from it, and equally explicit that "capturing and studying
the protocol as it actually behaves on the wire" is clean. This appendix is the
second thing.

**Safety.** Read forms only, against a hard exclusion list. Unknown CI-V space
is not inert: it contains `18 00` (power off — a one-way trip over WiFi, since
the WLAN interface goes with it), `1C 00` (keying), `1C 01` (the tuner cycle),
plus scan and memory writes. A read is `cmd + sub` with NO payload; adding a
payload is what makes it a set.

### E.1 Method, and the two ways it lied first

Worth recording, because both failures produced confident wrong answers rather
than errors:

1. **Scanning the trace ring newest-first** matched the app's OWN metering — an
   S-meter poll every 100 ms, a transmit-state poll every 250 — so probes were
   answered by somebody else's reply. Commands we *know* work came back
   "silent" while the sweep looked plausible. §1.9's shape exactly: a
   measurement that looks in the wrong place reads as absence.
2. **Diffing the ring by index** then returned nothing at all, because the ring
   is capped at 200 frames: once full its length stops growing. Every probe
   still reported success and the whole sweep came back blank.

Correlating by `ageMs` works, because age survives eviction. And a single-pass
negative is NOT evidence of absence — re-probing the misses three times each
recovered seven commands that had simply answered slower than the window. Any
future sweep must keep that retry pass.

**A command the app itself polls cannot be cleanly attributed** by this method,
since a matching reply may be the app's rather than ours. For `15 02`, `15 15`
and `1C 00` we already have ground truth from the implementation, so the sweep
is a discovery tool for everything ELSE.

### E.2 What the radio answers that we do not map

**Levels (`14 xx`)** — the radio answers 14, we map 10:

| CI-V | Read back | What it is | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `14 07` | 128 | **TWIN PBT (PBT1)** position | 0 = full CCW, 128 = centre, 255 = full CW |
| `14 08` | 128 | **TWIN PBT (PBT2)** position | the pair shifts and narrows the IF passband |
| `14 16` | 128 | VOX gain | |
| `14 19` | 128 | LCD backlight | not ours to drive |

**PBT is the interesting one.** We report the IF filter as three fixed widths
because that is all `filterForWidthHz` can reach — but the radio has a
continuous passband-tuning pair underneath it. A client that drove `14 07` /
`14 08` could offer real passband control on a radio we currently describe as
having three filters. That is a feature, not a defect, and it is the single
largest capability this sweep found.

**Functions (`16 xx`)** — the radio answers 21, we map 10:

| CI-V | Read back | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `16 42` | 0 | Repeater tone |
| `16 43` | 0 | Tone squelch |
| `16 47` | 0 | **BK-IN** — 00 off / 01 semi / 02 full |
| `16 4B` | 0 | DTCS |
| `16 4F` | 0 | Twin peak filter (RTTY) |
| `16 56` | **1** | DSP IF filter type — 00 SHARP / 01 SOFT |
| `16 57` | **1** | Manual notch width — W/M/N |
| `16 58` | 0 | SSB TX bandwidth — W/M/N |
| `16 5B` | 0 | DSQL / CSQL (DV) |
| `16 5C` | 0 | GPS TX mode |
| `16 5D` | 0 | Tone squelch type |

`16 47` is the one that matters for operators: CW break-in is unreachable today
and the radio plainly supports it.

### E.3 The questions this was run to answer

**Battery.** There is no battery command, and there does not need to be: on an
IC-705 `15 15` (Vd) IS the battery gauge. Read **7.98 V** on this radio — a
BP-272 pack at roughly 60–70 %, not a 13.8 V supply, which reads ~13.8 on the
same meter. One meter, two meanings, distinguished only by the value. We already
publish it to the status bar; what we do NOT do is say which of the two it is.

**Temperature.** Confirmed absent for the third time, now empirically as well as
from the guide. The `15 xx` space answers at `01, 02, 05, 07, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16` and nothing else. There is no PA-temperature meter on this radio.

**WiFi signal strength and network health.** Nothing in CI-V. Network health is
an RS-BA1 property, not a CI-V one, and we already measure it ourselves —
per-stream RTT, jitter, gap and packet loss, surfaced through `liveness`. Signal
strength is a radio-display value with no command behind it.

**Counters.** None. CI-V has no packet, error or uptime counters of any kind;
every counter AetherSDR shows for this radio is one it computes from the
transport.

### E.4 Scope geometry, confirmed

`27 12` and `27 13` both answer `00` and nothing else — one receiver, one scope,
exactly as `IcomModels` already assumes for the IC-705. `27 10` and `27 11`
answer `01`, confirming both switches are on: the scope is running AND its data
is being sent to us, which is the pair whose asymmetry is the number-one cause
of a black panadapter.

### E.5 What to do with this

1. **`16 47` BK-IN** — real operator feature, radio supports it, no seam verb.
2. **`14 07` / `14 08` TWIN PBT** — would turn our three-filter story into real
   passband tuning. Needs a UI decision, not just a verb.
3. **`16 56` / `16 57` / `16 58`** — SHARP/SOFT, notch width, TX bandwidth. All
   trivial once the DSP verbs exist.
4. **Say which Vd means.** A voltage that is a battery gauge below ~9 V and a
   supply rail above it should be labelled as such, not left as a bare number.
5. **Re-run this sweep against the IC-7300MK2** when one is available. The
   sweeper is model-agnostic and the JSON diffs cleanly, which is the cheapest
   possible way to establish a second model's capability set.

## CI-V identity and custom Network Radio Names (#5164)

Every connection begins with conservative unknown-model capabilities. The
RS-BA1 Network Radio Name is presentation text only, including names that
happen to match another supported model. CI-V `19 00` selects the profile from
its one-byte model-ID payload; the reply envelope's source address selects the
command destination. These values are independent when the operator changes
the CI-V address. This follows wfview's `funcTransceiverId` model-ID decode and
`determineRigCaps` adoption of `incomingCIVAddr` as the destination.

Auto broadcasts identity queries; a manually pinned address receives directed
queries and rejects other responders. Identification makes at most five attempts
one second apart, stopping on a valid model-ID reply, conflict, or disconnect.
A generic FB/FA reply or controller echo cannot complete identification. Meter,
PTT, and control polling wait until the destination is identified. Exhaustion
reports a configuration warning and keeps capabilities conservative; it never
starts a read burst at an unverified seed address or promotes a nickname to a
hardware profile. A valid late identity restarts the snapshot with the correct
model vocabulary and publishes capabilities, modes, antenna choices, front-end
controls, meters, and scope geometry. Repeated identical replies are inert.
Conflicting identities abort native CW at the previously selected destination
before withdrawing transmit capability until reconnect. A pinned selection
that hears only another responder reports both addresses once, without changing
the selection or accepting that responder's identity.

The current model table recognizes these hexadecimal `19 00` payloads. These
are model IDs, even though their values match factory CI-V addresses; changing
the operating address does not change the ID. Recognition alone does not imply
that every feature or network path has live-hardware validation.

| Model | Model-ID payload |
|---|---|
| IC-705 | `A4` |
| IC-9700 | `A2` |
| IC-7610 | `98` |
| IC-7850 / IC-7851 (`IC-785x` profile) | `8E` |
| IC-7300 | `94` |
| IC-7300MK2 | `B6` |
| IC-905 | `AC` |

Sources: the existing `IcomModels.cpp` model table and its Icom/wfview provenance;
Icom's per-model CI-V guides define `19 00` as the transceiver-ID read. The
IC-7300MK2 `B6` payload and destination were also confirmed by a receive-only
connection for this change. For example, `FE FE E0 50 19 00 A4 FD` identifies an
IC-705 whose operating address is `50`, regardless of its Network Radio Name.


### Optional standby wake (#5349, superseding #5360)

The connection panel exposes **Wake Icom on connect**, default off and persisted in
the existing Icom JSON settings document. An awake identity completes normally
without sending power commands. Only exhausted identity discovery with explicit
opt-in requests wake via the namespaced extension channel. Auto obtains the
wake destination from the capabilities record (absolute byte 0x94), not the
editable network name or the default settings seed. Pinned addresses remain
explicit overrides. This network metadata authorizes a destination only;
`19 00` remains the authority for the model and capabilities. An advertised factory destination for IC-705, IC-7300MK2 or IC-9700 can select
its wake framing without claiming model identity. An unidentified custom
address requires an explicit model selection: select the model in Connect by IP
(the network-advertised custom destination is retained), or use `civ wake` with
both model ID and address. A missing/unsupported framing hint refuses visibly;
it never silently gives a custom-address IC-9700 the standard E0 frame.

RadioModel owns one wake operation: one `18 01`, intentional session release,
a short initial allowance, then one fresh network session with wake disabled.
IC-705 and IC-7300MK2 start after one second and send per-second identity probes
until ready; IC-9700 retains the contributed ten-second delay.
The ordinary repeating reconnect timer is not armed during this operation.
Wire identity must arrive within 20 seconds after reconnect starts (and match
a model when one was explicitly selected);
failure terminates the attempt. Generation checks invalidate delayed work on
operator disconnect, radio changes, success and failure. No power-off is sent
on disconnect or exit, and no wake request or transient model claim is persisted.

Credit: W5JWP (@w5jwp) established the IC-9700 native-LAN wake sequence and
standby/readiness distinction in #5360. Its 150 additional FE bytes, E1 controller
address and 10-second delay are retained as contributed hardware evidence, not
as the guide's serial baud-rate requirements. The official IC-9700 guide lists
approximately 119 FE bytes at 115200 baud. IC-705 documents `18 01` from
Standby/Shutdown; IC-7300MK2 documents baud-dependent fill specifically for its
REMOTE jack. Both models have explicit profiles that send the standard E0-controller
`18 01` frame over the existing RS-BA1 serial envelope, without the IC-9700's
extra FE prefix. Their one-second initial allowance is client policy, not a guide timing.
These profiles implement the documented command; live network wake remains to
be checked on each model. Network control must remain reachable in standby;
an offline WLAN interface cannot receive CI-V wake.
