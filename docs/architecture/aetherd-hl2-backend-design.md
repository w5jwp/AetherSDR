# Hermes-Lite 2 Backend — Design Note

**Status:** Draft for maintainer review. A *new radio family* under the accepted
aetherd RFC §5.5, gated by AGENTS.md's rule that a new family "requires an
approved design doc naming its open protocol authority" (`AGENTS.md:334`). This
note is that prerequisite.

**Scope:** An in-tree `Hl2Backend : IRadioBackend` for the Hermes-Lite 2 (HPSDR
Protocol 1 / "Metis", raw-IQ over UDP:1024). Phase-1 target is a **working
receive path** — discover → stream → tune → engine-side demod → panadapter/audio
— behind the existing seam, with **zero** change to any UI or model consumer of
`IRadioBackend`. Transmit is explicitly out of scope for Phase 1. The data plane
and register facts are already proven against real hardware by the throwaway
spike in `tools/hl2/` (see its README); this note is the plan to port that
proof in-tree.

---

## 1. Why HL2 is the interesting backend

`IRadioBackend.h` was written anticipating exactly this case
(`src/core/backends/IRadioBackend.h:50-53`):

> DSP location is invisible here: a backend whose hardware demodulates and
> computes FFTs is a thin protocol decoder; one that ships raw samples owns an
> engine-side DSP chain — either way it emits the same normalized signals, so no
> consumer can tell the difference.

FlexBackend is the "thin protocol decoder" half: Flex hardware ships cooked audio
(24 kHz PCM) plus a hardware spectrum, and FlexBackend's job is almost entirely
`decodeXStatus` translation (FlexBackend's `decode*Status` translators). **HL2 is the other
half** — it ships nothing but raw IQ, so `Hl2Backend` must own an engine-side RX
DSP chain (tune → decimate → demodulate → FFT → S-meter) and then emit the same
normalized `sliceChanged` / `meterUpdate` / spectrum / audio outlets. It is the
first backend that exercises the "owns a DSP chain" branch of the seam, and thus
the first real test that the seam's abstraction holds.

**What the spike already proved** (`tools/hl2/`, live against a real HL2 at
gateware 7.4):

- Metis discovery (board id `0x06`), EP2/EP6 1032-byte framing, 0.00% loss.
- Sample-rate control (48/96/192/384 kHz) via the config C&C register.
- **RX1 NCO tuning** (`C0=0x04`, 32-bit Hz BE) — WWV 10 MHz lands exactly at
  baseband DC.
- ~~The non-obvious must-set: **`CONFIG_MERCURY`** (config C1 bit 6) selects the
  ADC as the DDC source; without it the stream is flat ADC-floor noise.~~
  **Corrected 2026-07-24:** this diagnosis was wrong. The HL2 gateware does not
  decode C1 bit 6 (`cmd_data[30]`) at all, so the bit cannot have been what fixed
  the flat-noise symptom. The actual cause is C&C **ordering**: a stream started
  before any Command & Control frame has landed emits ADC-idle samples. The cure
  is to prime with C&C frames *before* `metis-start` (see `MetisClient::
  sendPrimingBurst`). We still send the bit — it is meaningful on genuine
  openHPSDR Hermes/Mercury hardware and harmless here — but it is not load-bearing.
- LNA gain (`C0=0x14`, `C4 = 0x40 | (dB+12)`), −12…+48 dB.
- End-to-end FFT panadapter resolving WWV ~50 dB over the noise floor.

Protocol authority (Principle I): openHPSDR Protocol 1, the Hermes-Lite 2 wiki /
gateware, and the pihpsdr reference client — all consulted **clean-room**, no
code incorporated. Recorded under Protocol References in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`.

## 2. What `Hl2Backend` owns

Mirroring FlexBackend's ownership shape (it owns its wire objects and their
worker threads, constructed in a load-bearing order — FlexBackend's constructor),
`Hl2Backend` owns two internal, below-seam objects, each on its own worker
thread:

```
Hl2Backend : IRadioBackend
├── MetisClient        (UDP :1024 wire — discovery, start/stop, EP2 C&C egress,
│                       EP6 IQ ingest; owns the socket + its RX thread)
│      emits: iqBlockReady(complex<float> block), linkUp/linkDown, dropStats
│      accepts: setRxFrequencyHz(), setSampleRate(), setLnaGainDb()  (C&C)
└── Hl2Dsp            (engine-side fixed-block worker; one RX channel in Phase 1)
       in:  raw IQ blocks from MetisClient
       owns: WdspChannel RX  → complete IQ-to-audio chain
       out: demodulated PCM  → audio outlet
            FFT magnitude bins → spectrum/waterfall outlet
            S-meter level      → meterUpdate
```

`MetisClient` ports the proven `tools/hl2/hpsdr.py` register map and
framing primitives. `Hl2Dsp` replaces the spike's Python-only signal path with
the production engine boundary described below.
The modulation chain is not assembled from unrelated AetherSDR and WDSP stages.
The backend owns one complete, preplanned `WdspChannel` RX chain. A read-only
FFTW spectrum tap may observe raw IQ, but it is outside the audio path and may
not mutate it. See `docs/architecture/wdsp-integration.md` for the lifetime,
allocation, reconfiguration, and future TX contract.

The wire and DSP threads meet through a bounded SPSC IQ queue. UDP ingest never
waits for DSP. Queue starvation becomes a counted zero-IQ gap; overflow drops a
whole oldest block and records the lost sample interval. Both conditions are
observable backend metrics, not silent discontinuities.

Everything in this box lives under `src/core/backends/hl2/`, which is **below the
seam**: EB3 never inspects its includes and it may use any vendor/DSP header
freely (`tools/check_engine_boundary.py:66-67, 326-327`; `AGENTS.md:316-318`).
Only EB1/EB2 apply — no `gui/` include, no QtWidgets — which this backend never
needs. Adding the HL2 tree touches **no** ratchet baseline row and requires **no**
`aetherd-touchpoint-tags.json` change (nothing HL2 ends up above the seam).

---

## 3. Seam mapping

Each `IRadioBackend` verb/signal → HL2 mechanism. "Engine DSP" means the field
configures `Hl2Dsp`, not the radio — the fundamental HL2 difference from Flex,
where the same field would be a wire command.

### Intents DOWN

| Interface verb | HL2 realization |
|---|---|
| `connectRadio(req)` | **Real, unlike Flex's stub.** `MetisClient` opens the socket to `req.host:1024` (or a discovered HL2), sends the 3-register init (config incl. `CONFIG_MERCURY`, RX1 freq, LNA gain), starts EP6 ingest. Emits `connected()` on first EP6, `connectionError()` on timeout. |
| `disconnectRadio()` | Send Metis stop (`EF FE 04 00`), stop threads in reverse order. |
| `isConnected()` | `MetisClient` link state (EP6 flowing). |
| `setSliceFrequency(id, hz)` | `MetisClient::setRxFrequencyHz` → RX1 NCO `C0=0x04`. (Phase 1: single slice, `id` fixed.) |
| `setSliceMode(id, mode)` | **Engine DSP** — configures the backend-owned RX `WdspChannel` (AM/SSB/CW/FM/…). HL2 ships raw IQ, so mode is purely engine-side. |
| `setSliceFilter(id, lo, hi)` | **Engine DSP** — configures the RX `WdspChannel` passband on the control path. |
| `setSliceNoiseBlanker(id, on, level)` | **Engine DSP** — WDSP's ANB (`nob.c`) on the raw IQ ahead of the `WdspChannel`, per receiver ([screenshot](../screenshots/hl2-noise-blanker.png)). The HL2 runs no firmware DSP, so this is the same arrangement as the manual notch: the verb lands in WDSP on this host or it lands nowhere. `level` is 0..100 and rises with aggression; WDSP's own threshold is a multiple of the running average magnitude and therefore falls with it, so `WdspChannel::noiseBlankerThresholdForLevel()` owns the inversion. Held OFF across a transmit period — the mute path clocks the channel with silence, and a blanker whose reference average decays into that silence gates the start of the next receive period. The held stage is SKIPPED rather than flushed, so its average is frozen at the pre-transmit signal level and it is armed for the first receive sample; flushing on the T→R edge would re-arm it from full scale and leave it unable to trigger for ~200 ms of every receive period. `hasHostNoiseBlanker` is what makes the NB button visible. |
| `setKeying(bool)` | **Guarded no-op** — `capabilities().canTransmit == false`, so the engine TX guard (RFC §6) denies keying above the seam; the backend never keys. (TX is Phase 2+.) |
| `invokeExtension(...)` | Stub, exactly like FlexBackend (FlexBackend::invokeExtension): if `requestId != 0`, emit `extensionError` immediately. HL2 advertises **no** extension namespaces (see §4). |

### State UP

| Interface signal | HL2 source |
|---|---|
| `connected` / `disconnected` / `connectionError` | `MetisClient` link transitions. |
| `sliceChanged(id, SliceDelta)` | Emitted from the backend's **own authoritative state**. HL2 has no status wire echoing frequency/mode back (unlike Flex's `decodeSliceStatus`); the engine is the source of truth, so the backend reflects the settings it applied. |
| `meterUpdate("s-meter", v)` | `Hl2Dsp` S-meter (dBFS → dBm via a calibration constant; TBD, refine like `flex-meter-learnings.md`). |
| `panCenterBandwidthChanged(panId, ctr, span)` | Center = RX1 NCO MHz; span = sample-rate MHz. Backend-emitted from its own config. |
| `panRfGainChanged(panId, gain)` | LNA gain (−12…+48 dB) reflected back. |
| `spectrumFrameReady` / `audioFrameReady` | The DSP outlets — **but see §5 for how these actually reach the UI in Phase 1** (the interface's `QByteArray` data-plane signals are not the live path yet). |

Signals HL2 simply never emits in Phase 1 (no such hardware/wire): `transmitChanged`,
`amplifierChanged`, `tunerChanged`, `gpsChanged`, `memoryChanged`, `profileChanged`,
`meterDefined` catalog. RadioModel already tolerates a backend that stays silent
on these — the wiring is per-signal `connect()` with no "all-must-fire" contract
(RadioModel's interface-typed backend signal wiring).

---

## 4. Capabilities `Hl2Backend` advertises

Per `src/core/backends/RadioCapabilities.h:25-55`:

```cpp
RadioCapabilities caps;
caps.family              = "hl2";
caps.model               = "Hermes-Lite 2";      // + gateware ver from discovery
caps.maxSlices           = 1;                     // Phase 1; gateware supports more DDCs
caps.maxPanadapters      = 1;
caps.sampleRatesHz       = {48000, 96000, 192000, 384000};
caps.canTransmit         = false;                 // RFC §6 guard denies keying
caps.txPowerMaxWatts     = 0.0;
caps.hasTuner            = false;
caps.hasAmplifier        = false;
caps.hasExtendedDsp      = false;                 // DSP is engine-side, not firmware
caps.persistsMemories    = false;                 // no radio-side memory slots
caps.extensionNamespaces = {};                    // advertise NONE until step 3
```

`persistsMemories = false` is the struct's default, so HL2 gets it by saying
nothing — see §4a.

The empty `extensionNamespaces` follows FlexBackend's deliberate precedent
(FlexBackend's capabilities setup): advertising a namespace whose `invokeExtension`
can't yet reply would hang a client. HL2 keeps it empty until the step-3 encode
path lands.

---

## 4a. Memory channels have nowhere to live on an HL2

A Flex stores memory slots in the radio and re-dumps them to every client on
connect. The HL2 has no such storage, so the entire memory feature — the Memory
dialog, the browse panel, CSV import/export, the panadapter memory-spot feed,
the automation `memory activate` verb — had nothing underneath it: `memory
create` went to a command plane the backend does not own and was dropped, and
nothing ever came back.

The client keeps its own bank instead, selected by capability rather than by
family name:

| | Flex | HL2 / Kiwi / demo / not connected |
|---|---|---|
| `persistsMemories` | `true` | `false` (the default) |
| Slots live in | the radio | `~/.config/AetherSDR/memories.json` |
| Populated by | radio memory status on connect | `RadioModel::publishLocalMemories()` |

Three pieces, and one seam:

- **`LocalMemoryStore`** — versioned JSON (`aether.memories` v1), atomic writes
  via `QSaveFile`, sparse slot indices preserved. A file whose version is newer
  than the build fails the whole read and is never written back, so a downgrade
  cannot silently delete fields it does not understand.
- **`LocalMemoryBank`** — owns the slots, allocates the lowest free index,
  answers `memory create` / `set` / `remove` / `apply`, and debounces saves.
- **`RadioModel::tryMemoryCommand()`** — the seam, in `sendCmd()`. Every
  memory path in the app funnels through those four commands, so answering them
  there is what let all of the UX above keep working with **no changes to the
  memory dialog, the browse panel, the CSV codec, or the spot feed**.

Two ordering rules are load-bearing:

1. The bank stores what `RadioModel::applyMemoryChanges()` produced, not the
   kv-set that came in — that method owns the `0x7f`→space decode and the
   control-byte sanitisation, so persisting its output is what keeps the file
   identical to what the UI and a CSV export see.
2. Both stores number slots from 0. `syncMemoryStoreForSession()` clears the
   cache when connecting to a radio that owns its slots, so a locally-banked
   slot 0 published while disconnected cannot masquerade as the radio's.

The decode itself is shared: `MemoryWire::decodeStatus()` is used by both
`FlexBackend::decodeMemoryStatus()` and the bank, so a channel saved locally and
one read back from a Flex cannot land in `MemoryEntry` differently.

---

## 5. The two structural gaps HL2 forces (and how)

FlexBackend quietly bypasses the seam in two places. HL2 cannot, because it has
no Flex-shaped `RadioConnection`/`PanadapterStream` for RadioModel to reach into.
This is a feature: HL2 is the forcing function that closes both gaps minimally.

### Gap A — backend selection (no factory today)

`FlexBackend` is **hard-wired**: a `make_unique<FlexBackend>()` literal in
RadioModel's backend construction, plus a transitional concrete `FlexBackend* m_flexBackend`
alias and Flex-specific sink injection / object grabs
(`setCommandSink`, `connection()`, `panStream()`) — all in RadioModel.
The *signal-wiring* half (the interface-typed half) is already interface-typed and reusable;
the *construction* half is Flex-shaped.

**Proposal (minimal):** introduce a tiny backend-selection seam in RadioModel —
a `makeBackend(family)` that returns `unique_ptr<IRadioBackend>` — and move the
Flex-specific sink/object wiring behind a `if (auto* flex = dynamic_cast<FlexBackend*>...)`
adapter step, so a non-Flex backend simply skips it. This is the smallest change
that lets a second family exist; it does **not** require the full step-3 protocol.
The `dynamic_cast` shim is **explicitly interim** — it is the transitional stand-in
until the step-3 engine-side registry lands and each backend injects its own
sinks; the implementation PR should label it as such so it doesn't calcify.
Selection input for Phase 1 can be explicit (config/UI "radio family = HL2"),
deferring auto-discovery-driven selection.

### Gap B — data plane not through the seam

The interface's `spectrumFrameReady/audioFrameReady` (`QByteArray`) are **declared
but never emitted** by FlexBackend; the live path is the existing in-tree frame
types flowing off `PanadapterStream` and reached via `RadioModel::panStream()` —
`spectrumReady(QVector<float> binsDbm)` / `audioDataReady(QByteArray pcm)` →
`AudioEngine::feedAudioData` (`PanadapterStream.h:208-217`; MainWindow's audio-feed wiring).
The concrete seam frame formats are **step-4 work, not final**
(`IRadioBackend.h:210-216`; `aetherd-headless-engine-design.md:251-266`).

**Proposal (Phase 1 relays existing types):** `Hl2Dsp` produces the **same**
in-tree frame types the UI already consumes — `QVector<float>` dBm spectrum bins,
`QByteArray` 24 kHz PCM. Rather than invent a step-4 format now, expose them the
way RadioModel already consumes Flex's: the cleanest minimal option is a small
`spectrumSource()`/audio adapter on the backend that RadioModel binds the same
way it binds `panStream()` today. When step-4 finalizes the binary frame formats,
HL2 (and Flex) migrate to `spectrumFrameReady/audioFrameReady` together — HL2's
DSP output is already frame-shaped, so that migration is a re-wrap, not a rewrite.

**Sequencing:** both gaps are closable **without** waiting on step-3 (protocol) or
a finalized step-4 format. HL2 Phase 1 depends only on: (A) the small selection
seam, and (B) relaying existing frame types. TX, vendor extensions, remote/binary
data plane, and multi-RX all wait for their respective later steps.

---

## 6. Explicitly out of scope for Phase 1

- **Transmit.** `canTransmit=false`; `setKeying` is a guarded no-op. The WDSP
  foundation can construct a TX channel for deterministic tests, but that is
  deliberately disconnected from all radio I/O. Live TX needs the
  MOX bit + a TX-IQ data plane + the engine TX arbiter (RFC §6 / step 4-arbitration)
  and is deliberately deferred — it is also the only path that can key a radio, so
  keeping it out of Phase 1 is the safe default.
- **Multiple DDC receivers.** Gateware supports them; Phase 1 is one slice / one pan.
- **Vendor extensions.** No namespaces advertised until the step-3 encode path exists.
- **Discovery-driven UI selection / multi-radio.** Phase 1 connects to an explicit
  host; enumeration is a later enhancement (the spike's `discover.py` proves it works).

---

## 7. Clean-room provenance (allowed inputs)

Consistent with the KiwiSDR precedent (`docs/kiwisdr-cleanroom-design.md`) and the
`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` Protocol-References entry. `Hl2Backend` is implemented from
clean AetherSDR interfaces plus **protocol facts** (not code) consulted from
GPL/open sources. Allowed inputs used:

- **openHPSDR Protocol 1** (TAPR, GPL-2.0) — Metis discovery handshake, EP2/EP6
  1032-byte frame layout, the C0 `(addr<<1)|MOX` register-address encoding.
- **Hermes-Lite 2 wiki / gateware** (KF7O + contributors) — board id `0x06`,
  supported sample rates, register `0x0a` LNA gain (C4 bit 6 selects the
  direct-value mapping; the gateware's own reset default is `7'b1000000`), the
  RUNSTOP watchdog bit, and — by inspection of the RTL — confirmation that the
  `CONFIG_MERCURY` and duplex config bits are *not* decoded on this hardware.
- **pihpsdr `src/old_protocol.c`** (DL1YCF, GPL-3.0) — consulted as a *behavioral
  reference* for the minimal round-robin C&C init sequence a receiver needs.
- **Live black-box observation** of the AetherSDR-owned HL2 (register effects on
  the IQ stream), recorded in `tools/hl2/`.

No openHPSDR, Hermes-Lite 2, or pihpsdr source is incorporated, vendored,
translated, or linked. The facts above are expressed in original AetherSDR code.
Because AetherSDR is itself GPL-3, direct adaptation would also be permissible,
but clean-room is chosen to match project convention.

---

## 8. Resolved decisions & open questions

**Resolved**
- HL2 is one `IRadioBackend` implementor, RX-only in Phase 1 (RFC §5.5 Q3: one
  interface, `canTransmit=false`, guarded `setKeying`).
- DSP is engine-side and encapsulated below the seam. One backend-owned WDSP
  channel owns the complete RX modulation chain; it is never interleaved with
  `AudioEngine` stages. Consumers see the same normalized signals (RFC §5.5,
  `IRadioBackend.h:50-53`).
- FFT planning, allocation, and rate changes are control-path work. Live rate
  changes prebuild a replacement channel and swap it at a block boundary.
- Metis ingest and DSP communicate through a bounded SPSC queue with explicit
  gap/overflow metrics; neither the UDP thread nor DSP callback blocks the other.
- Below-seam placement under `src/core/backends/hl2/` — no EB3/tags impact.
- Protocol authority named and consulted clean-room (Principle I / AGENTS.md:334).

**Open (for maintainer input)**
- **Backend-selection seam shape (Gap A):** `makeBackend(family)` factory in
  RadioModel now, vs. deferring until step-3 lands a fuller engine-side registry.
  Recommendation: the minimal factory now — HL2 is the concrete second family
  that justifies it, and it's a prerequisite for HL2 existing at all.
- **Phase-1 data-plane wiring (Gap B):** relay existing `QVector<float>`/`QByteArray`
  frame types via a `panStream()`-analogue, vs. emitting the interface's
  `QByteArray` data-plane signals early with a RadioModel bridge. Recommendation:
  relay existing types (matches how Flex reaches the UI today; least churn; both
  families migrate to step-4 formats together later).
- **S-meter calibration:** dBFS→dBm constant for the AD9866 front end; refine
  empirically as in `docs/architecture/flex-meter-learnings.md`.

---

## 9. Phasing

0. **Foundation — complete.** Pinned WDSP 2.00 static library, portability
   boundary, RAII channel owner, and deterministic RX/TX/lifecycle tests. This
   phase has no radio I/O and cannot key hardware.
1. **1a — MetisClient + Hl2Dsp in-tree** (port the spike; unit-tested against
   captured EP6 fixtures and packet-gap cases). One RX `WdspChannel`; no
   RadioModel change yet.
2. **1b — backend-selection seam** (Gap A): `makeBackend`, Flex-sink adapter step.
3. **1c — data-plane relay** (Gap B): HL2 DSP frames reach the existing UI path;
   first live in-app HL2 panadapter + audio.
4. **1d — capabilities + connect UX**: family reporting, explicit-host connect,
   error surfacing.

5. **Phase 2 — TX after RX soak.** Add a separate preplanned WDSP TX channel,
   audio-to-EP2 buffering, hard operator-intent/MOX gates, and clear-MOX-first
   teardown. Prove into a dummy load before advertising `canTransmit=true`.

Later (own steps): discovery-driven selection, multi-RX, vendor extensions,
migration to finalized step-4 binary frames, then the cross-platform receiver
count/rate benchmark matrix in `wdsp-integration.md`.
