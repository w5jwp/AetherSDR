# Agent guide — SmartSDR protocol, multi-pan, multi-client

Part of [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). Read this before touching the Flex wire
path (`src/core/backends/flex/`), slice/pan/status handling, Multi-Flex
behavior, or the model↔radio command flow. FlexLib is the protocol authority
(Constitution Principle I).

## SmartSDR Protocol (v1.4.0.0)

### Message Types

| Prefix | Dir | Meaning |
|--------|-----|---------|
| `V` | Radio→Client | Firmware version |
| `H` | Radio→Client | Hex client handle |
| `C` | Client→Radio | Command: `C<seq>\|<cmd>\n` |
| `R` | Radio→Client | Response: `R<seq>\|<hex_code>\|<body>` |
| `S` | Radio→Client | Status: `S<handle>\|<object> key=val ...` |
| `M` | Radio→Client | Informational message |

Status object names are **multi-word** (`slice 0`, `display pan 0x40000000`,
`interlock band 9`). The parser finds the split between object name and
key=value pairs by locating the last space before the first `=` sign.

### Connection Sequence

1. TCP connect → radio sends `V<version>` then `H<handle>`
2. `sub <topic> all` for each of: `slice`, `pan`, `tx`, `amplifier`, `atu`,
   `meter`, `audio`, `gps`, `apd`, `client`, `xvtr`
3. `client gui` + `client program AetherSDR` + `client station AetherSDR`
4. Bind UDP socket, send `\x00` to radio:4992 (port registration)
5. `client udpport <port>` (returns error 0x50001000 on v1.4.0.0 — expected)
6. `slice list` → if empty, create default slice (14.225 MHz USB ANT1)
7. `stream create type=remote_audio_rx compression=none` → radio starts sending
   VITA-49 audio to our UDP port

### Protocol / Firmware Quirks (v1.4.0.0 protocol on fw 4.x)

- `client set udpport` returns `0x50001000` — use the one-byte UDP packet method
- `client set enforce_local_ptt=1` returns `0x50001000` — correct command is `client set local_ptt=1`; the radio echoes a full `connected` status to ALL clients updating their `local_ptt` field when ownership changes
- Slice frequency is `RF_frequency` (not `freq`) in status messages
- Streams are discriminated by **PacketClassCode** (PCC), NOT by packet type
- `audio_level` is the status key for AF gain (not `audio_gain`)
- The radio **never sends `mox=` in transmit status messages**. Use
  `isTransmitting()` (interlock state machine), NOT `isMox()`
- Three separate tune command paths all need interlock inhibit:
  `transmit tune 1`, `tgxl autotune`, `atu start`
- `cw key immediate` not supported — use netcw UDP stream for CW keying
- `transmit set break_in=1` wrong — correct: `cw break_in 1`

## GUI↔Radio Sync (No Feedback Loops)

> **The `commandReady` plane is FROZEN and is being removed** (#5262 M4).
> It is described here because most of the tree still uses it, not as the
> pattern for new work: the wire text is Flex-only and silently dropped on
> HL2/Icom/ANAN/RTL. A new control emits a **typed intent** through
> `IRadioBackend` instead (see [backends.md](backends.md), command-plane
> freeze).

- Model setters emit `commandReady(cmd)` → `RadioModel` sends to radio
- Radio status pushes update models via `applyStatus(kvs)`
- Use `m_updatingFromModel` guard or `QSignalBlocker` to prevent echo loops

**First M4 receive group (#5904).** Frequency, mode, filter and AGC now use
one `RadioModel::wireSliceReceiveIntentsToBackend` binding at both slice
construction sites. Frequency/filter/AGC carry `ReceiveCommand.h` requests:
pan preservation versus recentering, operator/adaptive/mode-normalization
filter origin, and the selected AGC field plus the host-DSP pair. Mode uses
`setSliceMode`. Flex encodes these behind the guarded slice sink; mode-only
filter normalization does not overwrite its radio-owned filter memory.
Legacy `frequencyCommandIssued`, `filterCommandIssued` and `agcCommandIssued`
are local notifications, **not additional dispatch paths**. Keep frequency
display notification before its provenance notification: linked slices rely
on that order. Ordinary status never emits a receive request. Bindings are
idempotent, synchronous on the owner thread and check exact active slice
identity, so stale objects cannot control reused ids. Daemon targets keep
their own admission and observation-only state semantics; do not replace
them with optimistic desktop setters or infer a new capability from these
desktop verbs. AGC off-level remains unsupported by the default backend
adapter, and no daemon AGC method is added.

## Auto-Reconnect

`RadioModel` has a 3-second `m_reconnectTimer` for unexpected disconnects.
Disabled by `m_intentionalDisconnect` flag on user-initiated disconnect.

## Optimistic Updates Policy

Some radio commands lack status echo (e.g. `tnf remove`). Update the local
model optimistically. **File a GitHub issue** tagged `protocol` + `upstream`
for each missing status echo — optimistic updates break Multi-Flex.

## Multi-Panadapter Support

**Architecture:** PanadapterModel (per-pan state), PanadapterStream (VITA-49
routing by stream ID), PanadapterStack (QSplitter), wirePanadapter() (per-pan
signal wiring), spectrumForSlice() (overlay routing).

**Key protocol facts:**
- Click-to-tune: `slice m <freq> pan=<panId>` — NOT `slice tune`
- Never send `slice set <id> active=1` — managed client-side only
- Push `xpixels`/`ypixels` on pan creation (radio defaults to 50×20)
- FFT stream ID = pan ID (0x40xx), waterfall stream ID = waterfall ID (0x42xx)

See `docs/architecture/multi-pan-pitfalls.md` for the numbered pitfalls.

## Multi-Client (Multi-Flex) Support

Filter all status and VITA-49 packets by `client_handle` — three layers:
1. **Slice ownership**: track `m_ownedSliceIds` from `client_handle` field
2. **Panadapter status**: only claim `display pan`/`display waterfall` matching our handle
3. **VITA-49 UDP**: `setOwnedStreamIds(panId, wfId)` drops non-matching packets

Early status messages arrive WITHOUT `client_handle`. Create SliceModels for
all initially, remove other clients' when handle arrives.

## KiwiSDR / Web-888 receivers

The KiwiSDR browser is a clean-room, API-policy-aware public-receiver directory
(#3679), independent of the FlexRadio protocol path. Kiwi panadapters are
receive-only (TX is inhibited). See `docs/kiwisdr-public-directory.md` and
`docs/kiwisdr-cleanroom-design.md` (Principle IV). The Kiwi path also serves
the Web-888 (a KiwiSDR server fork): profiles carry a receiver type, and the
client applies the small wire deltas — see `docs/web888-cleanroom-design.md`.
