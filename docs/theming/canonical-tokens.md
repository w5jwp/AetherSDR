# Canonical token taxonomy for AetherSDR theming (RFC #3076 Phase 2)

This document fixes the design-system token set that the Phase 2
stylesheet migration converts every hardcoded colour to.  Generated
from `tools/audit_colours.py` output (3621 references across 524
unique colours) by clustering close variants into a smaller canonical
set.

> Writing new UI? The agent-facing rules for *using* these tokens —
> the semantic system-state map, the no-new-literals rule, and the
> add-a-token path for new UX — live in
> [`docs/style/theme-style-guide.md`](../style/theme-style-guide.md).
> This file is the migration inventory behind them.

## Methodology

The audit produced 524 unique colours.  Frequency distribution:

| Count bucket | Unique colours |
|---|---|
| Used 50+ times | 10 |
| Used 20-49 times | 25 |
| Used 10-19 times | 21 |
| Used 5-9 times | 62 |
| Used 2-4 times | 195 |
| Used exactly once | 211 |

**Canonicalisation rule:** every colour within ΔRGB ≤ ~24 of a canonical
token's hex value collapses onto that token.  In practice this means
that close variants — for instance `#1a2a3a`, `#203040`, `#1e2e3e`,
`#2a3a4a`, `#1a2230`, `#2a3744` are all "blue-grey panel mid-tier" —
become a single `color.background.1` token.  The post-migration UI
will have sub-perceptual visual differences (most variants differ by
1-3 RGB units, well below the eye's discrimination threshold at the
GUI's display brightness).

Result: **42 canonical tokens** covering ~95% of references.  The 211
single-use colours snap to the nearest canonical neighbour.

## Token set

### Backgrounds (6 tiers)

| Token | Canonical | Refs (collapses) |
|---|---|---|
| `color.background.0` | `#0a0e14` | `#0a0a14` (46), `#0a0a18` (40), `#08121d` (23), `#0e1b28` (23), `#0f0f1a` (84 — spectrum), `#1a1a2e` (24), `#0a1420` (19) ≈ 259 refs |
| `color.background.1` | `#1a2a3a` | `#1a2a3a` (182), `#203040` (131), `#204060` (40), `#243a4e` (30), `#1e2e3e` (26), `#2a3a4a` (26), `#2a3744` (18), `#1a2230` (18), `#2a4458` (22) ≈ 493 refs |
| `color.background.2` | `#304050` | `#304050` (142), `#205070` (45), `#506070` (43), `#404858` (16), `#1a3a5a` (17), `#0070c0` (27 — selected) ≈ 290 refs |
| `color.background.3` | `#506070` | raised surface — popups, dialog headers |
| `color.background.tx` | `#3a2a0e` | TX-active panel tint: `#3a2a0e` (22), `#4a3a1e` (13) ≈ 35 refs |
| `color.background.spectrum` | `#000000` | spectrum/oscilloscope: `#000000` (29) — pure black, distinct from background.0 because the spectrum has its own canvas |

### Text (4 tiers)

| Token | Canonical | Refs (collapses) |
|---|---|---|
| `color.text.primary` | `#e6f0fa` | `#c8d8e8` (369 — most-referenced colour in codebase), `#d7e7f2` (29), `#d7e4f2` (12), `#d4deea` (9), `#e0f0ff` (6), `#ffffff` (94 — high-emphasis) ≈ 519 refs |
| `color.text.secondary` | `#8ea8c0` | `#8aa8c0` (132), `#8090a0` (57), `#7f93a5` (30), `#8d99ad` (20), `#a0b0c0` (11), `#a0b4c8` (7) ≈ 257 refs |
| `color.text.label` | `#506070` | `#808080` (47), `#607080` (16), `#6a8090` (15) ≈ 78 refs — dimmed labels, axis text |
| `color.text.disabled` | `#3a4a5a` | currently overlaps with label tier; will surface a distinct tone in default-dark v2 for accessibility |

### Accents (cyan family)

| Token | Canonical | Refs (collapses) |
|---|---|---|
| `color.accent` | `#00b4d8` | `#00b4d8` (170) — primary brand cyan, untouched |
| `color.accent.bright` | `#00c8f0` | `#00c8f0` (20), `#00c8ff` (15) ≈ 35 refs — hover / focused states |
| `color.accent.dim` | `#0070c0` | `#0090e0` (35), `#0070c0` (27), `#008ba8` (13), `#4db8d4` (17) ≈ 92 refs — desaturated cyan for non-primary surfaces; canonical value matches the legacy `kBlueActive` checked-button fill so tokenised active states render identically to pre-refactor sites |

### Status accents

| Token | Canonical | Refs (collapses) |
|---|---|---|
| `color.accent.success` | `#4dd87a` | `#00ff88` (39), `#00a060` (25), `#66d19e` (15), `#00e060` (14), `#30d050` (14), `#006040` (25 — background variant) ≈ 132 refs |
| `color.accent.warning` | `#ffb84d` | `#f2c14e` (81), `#ffd070` (9), `#e8a540` (9), `#e8b977` (7), `#ff8c00` (6), `#ffff00` (8) ≈ 120 refs |
| `color.accent.danger` | `#ff4d4d` | `#ff4444` (12), `#ff4040` (11), `#ff6b6b` (10), `#c03030` (9), `#ff8080` (8) ≈ 50 refs |

### Borders

| Token | Canonical | Refs |
|---|---|---|
| `color.border.subtle` | `#1a2330` | hairline panel separators (~80 refs collapsed) |
| `color.border.strong` | `#2a3a4d` | container borders, focused outlines (~60 refs) |
| `color.border.accent` | `#00b4d8` | active / selected border highlight |
| `color.border.tx` | `#5a4a28` | TX-active border (matches `background.tx` family) |

### Meter colours (specialised — paint code only)

| Token | Canonical | Refs |
|---|---|---|
| `color.meter.crst` | `#ff4d4d` | crest factor peak indicator |
| `color.meter.rms` | `#00b4d8` | RMS bar fill |
| `color.meter.thresh` | `#ffb84d` | threshold marker |
| `color.meter.peak` | `#e6f0fa` | peak-hold tick |
| `color.meter.gainReduction` | `#f2c14e` | GR meter bar |
| `color.meter.bar.fill` | `#405060` | meter bar inactive fill (~31 refs) |

### Spectrum / waterfall (specialised — paint code only)

| Token | Canonical | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `color.spectrum.trace` | `#00b4d8` | live FFT trace |
| `color.spectrum.peakHold` | `#ffb84d` | **RESERVED — nothing paints this.** See the note below |
| `color.spectrum.average` | `#8ea8c0` | **RESERVED — nothing paints this.** See the note below |
| `color.spectrum.grid` | `#1a2330` | dB/frequency grid lines |
| `color.waterfall.colormap.*` | (gradient family — Phase 2 gradient support) | the RF colormap presets: `.default`, `.grayscale`, `.blueGreen`, `.fire`, `.plasma`, `.purple`, `.glacier`. One linear gradient per `WfColorScheme` enumerator; the Display ▸ Scheme selector is generated from that enum. `.glacier` is the only preset whose `at: 0.00` stop is not `#000000` — cleared waterfall pixels take `waterfallFloorRgb()` (the `t=0` colour) rather than black so its deep-blue floor is continuous |
| `color.spectrum.zoomButton.disabled.background` | `#5a0f0f1a` | disabled state of the waterfall zoom / band-segment buttons |
| `color.spectrum.zoomButton.disabled.border` | `#5a304050` | as above, border |
| `color.spectrum.zoomButton.disabled.text` | `#8c90a0b0` | as above, glyph |

#### `color.spectrum.peakHold` and `color.spectrum.average` are RESERVED

Nothing paints either token. They are defined under `color.spectrum` in
`resources/themes/default-dark.json` and `default-light.json`, emitted into
`src/core/ThemeSeedGenerated.cpp` by `tools/gen_theme_seed.py`, and listed in
`SpectrumWidget`'s `declareWidgetTokens()` call so an Inspect-mode click on the
panadapter produces a hit-list. That is every occurrence: no painter, no shader
UBO and no `ThemeManager::color()` lookup resolves either one.

Both entered in #3080 as 2 of 51 tokens generated wholesale under theming RFC
#3076, which locked the token vocabulary and assumed each overlay as a region to
colour — it never proposed building one. The only design work is @ten9876's
2026-03-29 decomposition of #333 (item 4, *FFT Peak Hold / Max Hold*),
explicitly deferred to community interest. Painting either needs an approved RFC
first (GOVERNANCE.md: *"Any change to **visual design**"*); #5561, which ruled on
the existing trace's line width, is the bar.

**`peakHold`** — there is no peak-hold overlay on the panadapter: no hold state,
no draw pass, no control. (`SMeterWidget` draws a peak-hold line, but that is a
different surface with its own `color.meter.*` tokens.)

**`average`** — no backend draws a *separate* averaged trace, which is what this
token was for. Do not read that as "there is no averaging": there is, in three
places that are not this token.

- **The live trace is client-smoothed, unless the backend already averaged.**
  `SpectrumWidget::updateSpectrum` runs `m_smoothed[i] = SMOOTH_ALPHA * bins[i]
  + (1 - SMOOTH_ALPHA) * m_smoothed[i]` at `SMOOTH_ALPHA = 0.35f`, except when
  `m_clientFftSmoothing` is off: then `m_smoothed` copies the frame straight
  through. `MainWindow` turns that flag off while connected if
  `RadioCapabilities::backendPanAveraging` is set, so the widget does not
  average a second time. Today ANAN and HL2 set that capability. That paint does
  not use `color.spectrum.trace` either — `SpectrumWidget` draws the trace in
  `m_fftFillColor` / `m_fftLineColor`, which are operator settings rather than
  tokens. `color.spectrum.trace` is resolved only by `BandscopeDialog` and, as
  a fallback, by `MiniPanScope`.
- **`SpectrumWidget::setFftAverage` stores a number no render path reads.** It
  is not an unused member — two snapshots and the overlay-menu sync read it
  (@ten9876's correction on #5678). On a raw-spectrum backend
  `RadioModel::requestPanAverage` applies it in the `shapesDisplayRatesLocally()`
  branch: ANAN turns it into WDSP analyzer averaging TIME
  (`AnanBackend::setPanAverage`, steps of `kMsPerAverageStep`). HL2 and RTL do
  not override `setPanAverage()`, so the slider still does not average their
  spectra.
- **On Flex the averaging is the radio's.** The same function sends
  `display pan set <pan> average=<n>` and the Flex display engine applies it, so
  the bins that arrive are already averaged and those are what is drawn.

Where client-side averaging should live for the backends that still do none
(HL2, RTL), and in which domain, is still open — see #5782 and #5794.

The three `zoomButton.disabled.*` tokens are the exception to this section's
"paint code only" heading — they are consumed from a QSS template through
`ThemeManager::applyStyleSheet()`, not from a painter.

These tokens use the enabled colours at reduced opacity against the widget's
own dark backdrop. Both bundled themes carry the same values to preserve that
dimming, while theme authors can override each role.

Store translucent values in canonical `#AARRGGBB` format so `QColor` and the
Theme Editor can read them and restore their factory values. The stylesheet
resolver converts that storage format to `rgba()` before applying QSS; raw
`rgba()` token values would bypass the editor's colour and Reset paths.

The AetherRX/AetherTX footer toggles use
`color.toggle.footer.{warning,danger,success}.background.{checked,hover}`.
The checked and hover fills have alpha `2d` and `46` respectively, and use
the amber, red and green accent RGB values. Both bundled themes define all
six tokens so the footer stays editable and follows theme changes.

### Hardware-display colours (specialised — paint code only)

| Token | Canonical | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `color.spe.lcd.background` | `#102010` | SPE Expert LCD glass background |
| `color.spe.lcd.foreground` | `#d6f5d6` | illuminated SPE Expert LCD pixel |
| `color.spe.lcd.dim` | `#3a553a` | waiting-for-display text |
| `color.spe.lcd.bezel` | `#222822` | SPE Expert LCD bezel |

### Slice indicators

| Token | Canonical | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `color.slice.a`–`color.slice.h` | TBD per slice | one per slice letter; current code uses scattered per-slice colours that need a consolidated palette |
| `color.slice.tx` | `#ff4d4d` | active-TX slice highlight |

### Font tokens

| Token | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `font.family.ui` | `Inter` | |
| `font.family.mono` | `monospace` | |
| `font.family.segment7` | `DSEG7 Modern` | bundled (SIL OFL 1.1) via `third_party/dseg/`; all six weights loaded at startup from `:/fonts/DSEG7Modern-*.ttf` |
| `font.family.segment14` | `DSEG14 Modern` | bundled (SIL OFL 1.1) via `third_party/dseg/`; all six weights loaded at startup from `:/fonts/DSEG14Modern-*.ttf` |
| `font.family.weather` | `DSEGWeather` | bundled (SIL OFL 1.1) via `third_party/dseg/DSEGWeather/`; icon font keyed off ASCII letters. |
| `font.family.freq` | `DSEG7 Modern` | widget-class token — `VfoWidget` + `RxApplet` frequency labels read this so the operator can swap font families across both surfaces with one pick in the Theme Editor.  Defaults to `DSEG7 Modern` so a fresh install gets the segment look out of the box; reset to `Inter` or `monospace` for a plain proportional / fixed look. |
| `font.family.temp` | `DSEG7 Modern` | widget-class token — temperature readouts (band-conditions / propagation surfaces, future temperature widgets) read this so the operator can theme them independently from `font.family.freq`.  Same default as `freq` for visual consistency on a fresh install. |
| `font.size.tiny` | 9 | |
| `font.size.small` | 10 | |
| `font.size.normal` | 12 | |
| `font.size.large` | 14 | |

### Sizing tokens (unchanged from Phase 1 seed)

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `sizing.panel.padding` | 4 |
| `sizing.panel.spacing` | 4 |
| `sizing.panel.cornerRadius` | 4 |
| `sizing.border.subtle` | 1 |
| `sizing.border.strong` | 2 |

## Token count summary

- Backgrounds: **6**
- Text: **4**
- Accents: **6** (3 cyan family + 3 status)
- Borders: **4**
- Meters: **6**
- Spectrum / waterfall: **5** (4 scalar + 1 gradient)
- Slice: **9** (A–H + TX)
- Font: **6**
- Sizing: **5**

**Total: 51 tokens** — comfortably inside the 50-80 envelope from the RFC.

## Migration risks

- **Pure black for spectrum** (`color.background.spectrum = #000000`) is intentionally distinct from `color.background.0 = #0a0e14`.  Spectrum widgets paint a pure-black canvas for maximum contrast against the trace; collapsing them onto background.0 would make the spectrum harder to read.  Keep separate.
- **Warning family is wide** (`#f2c14e` to `#ffff00` to `#ff8c00`).  The canonical `#ffb84d` is a middle.  Sites using `#ffff00` (pure yellow) will shift visibly.  Audit those specific sites before conversion — if the visual change is unacceptable, add a `color.accent.warning.bright` token.
- **`color.text.disabled` currently overlaps with `color.text.label`** in the existing codebase (both are around #506070-ish).  Migration introduces a distinct token even though they look identical today, so Phase 4's Light theme can give them different contrast values without breaking the dark theme.
- **Per-slice colours need a separate small audit** before locking the slice taxonomy — current code has them scattered across SliceLabel, SliceModel, indicator paint code.

## Acceptance criteria for the migration

- All ~3621 colour references replaced with a canonical token lookup
- `default-dark.json` expanded from 24 to ~51 tokens
- Default Dark UI runs side-by-side with v26.5.3 and shows no perceptible visual diff except for the documented intentional shifts (warning bright yellow → middle yellow, etc.)
- Audit re-run on post-migration `src/` shows 0 hardcoded colours (or only documented exemptions like resource files)

## Next steps

1. **Lock the taxonomy** — review this doc, edits, agreement
2. **Expand `default-dark.json`** with the 51 tokens
3. **Pilot conversion on one shared stylesheet** — pick `src/gui/SliceLabel.h` or `src/gui/CommonStyles.h` to validate the mechanical conversion process
4. **Mass conversion in batches** — file-by-file, with diff-screenshot review
5. **Resolver records widget→token reverse-map** as conversions land (feeds Phase 5 inspector)

## Optional dark basemap palette

`color.map.darkBackground` and `color.map.darkDetail` are the endpoints of the
PSK Reporter dark-map luminance ramp. Both bundled themes use the same dark
cartographic palette; selecting the light app theme does not turn an explicitly
enabled dark map light. These tokens affect only basemap images, not data
overlays, attribution, or window chrome.

### Waterfall time markers

`color.waterfall.timeMarker.foreground` is the pale gray-blue foreground for
UTC row annotations. Lines use 55% of its opacity; timestamp text uses its full
opacity. `color.waterfall.timeMarker.background` provides a compact translucent
dark text backing. Both bundled themes retain the same colors because waterfall
signal palettes do not invert when application chrome changes theme. These
annotations are independent of RX/TX, warning, and selection colors.
