# Agent Automation Bridge

AetherSDR is a **Qt 6 Widgets** native app — no QML, no web layer, so there is
no DOM or browser tooling to drive. The automation bridge is the in-process
substitute: an opt-in command channel that exposes the widget tree and lets you
capture any widget (including the GPU panadapter) as a PNG. It is the
deterministic, cross-OS way to do "snapshot → act → assert" testing of the UI.

Introduced in issue
[#3646](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/3646) (Phase 0). Off in
production; it only exists when you ask for it via an env var.

---

## When to use it

| Goal | Use the bridge? |
|---|---|
| Assert a control's state after a change (slider value, button checked, label text) | **Yes** — `dumpTree`, read the `value` field. No screenshot needed. |
| Confirm a widget exists / is enabled / has the right accessibleName | **Yes** — `dumpTree`. |
| Capture what the panadapter/waterfall actually rendered | **Yes** — `grab SpectrumWidget`. |
| Visually check a dialog or applet layout | **Yes** — `grab <widget>` → view the PNG. |
| Click a button or move a slider programmatically | **Yes** — `invoke <target> <action> [value]`. |
| Read live model truth (freq, mode, center, dBm, NB/NR) | **Yes** — `get radio\|slice\|pan …`. Assert on state, no pixels. |
| Key the radio (MOX/PTT/Tune) | **Only deliberately** — `invoke` refuses transmit controls by design; the dedicated [transmit verbs](#transmit-verbs--gated) (`key`/`cwx`/`txtest`/`atu`/`transmit`) work **only** under `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1` (see [TX safety](#tx-safety)). |
| Read client-side DSP / window / floor state | **Yes** — `get dsp`, `dumpTree` `windowState`, `floors`. |

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Build with the bridge available (it's compiled in unconditionally;
#    the env var below is what turns it on at runtime).
cmake --build build --parallel

# 2. Launch the app with the bridge enabled.
AETHER_AUTOMATION=1 ./build/AetherSDR.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherSDR &   # macOS
#   AETHER_AUTOMATION=1 ./build/AetherSDR &                            # Linux/Windows

# 3. Drive it. The dependency-free probe needs no Qt:
python3 tools/automation_probe.py ping
python3 tools/automation_probe.py demo --out /tmp/phase0   # → tree.json + panadapter.png
```

`demo` produces the two canonical artifacts: a semantic snapshot of the UI
(`tree.json`) and a PNG of the live panadapter (`panadapter.png`). View the PNG
to confirm a visual change; parse the JSON to assert on control state.

For headless / CI runs, add `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` — no display required.
Saved-radio autoconnect follows the `AutoConnectToLastRadio` setting; a bridge
run reconnects to the last radio just as an interactive launch does. Use the
`connect` verb to drive a specific radio, or clear the setting to start idle.

Parallel worktrees should give each bridge a stable automation identity and a
human-readable agent name:

```bash
AETHER_AUTOMATION=1 \
AETHER_AUTOMATION_IDENTITY=issue-4166-worktree \
AETHER_AUTOMATION_AGENT_NAME=Codex-GPT-5.6 \
AETHER_AUTOMATION_SOCKET=aethersdr-4166 \
./build/AetherSDR.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherSDR
```

`AETHER_AUTOMATION_IDENTITY` deterministically selects a process-scoped Flex
GUI client UUID, so concurrent worktrees do not displace one another through
the radio's duplicate-client takeover behavior. If it is omitted, the socket,
automation label, or PID is used in that order (transient identity, so multi-slice
session restore is not preserved across runs; set a stable identity when testing
session persistence). `AETHER_AUTOMATION_AGENT_NAME`
sets the station label shown to other Multi-Flex clients; the legacy
`AETHER_AUTOMATION_STATION` and then `AETHER_AUTOMATION_LABEL` are fallbacks,
followed by the neutral default `Automation`. The agent name is display-only
and is never used as the UUID because several worktrees may use the same LLM.
Automation identities never overwrite the user's persistent `GUIClientID`.

KiwiSDR compression can be forced for diagnostic runs by adding
`AETHER_KIWI_SND_COMP=1` and/or `AETHER_KIWI_WF_COMP=1` at launch. These are
receive-only automation knobs: SND changes the outbound sound setup request
from `SET compression=0` to `SET compression=1`; W/F changes the outbound
waterfall setup request from `SET wf_comp=0` to `SET wf_comp=1`. The runtime
still decodes the actual observed frame layout. The `get kiwi` snapshot exposes
top-level `diagnosticSoundCompressionRequested` and
`diagnosticWaterfallCompressionRequested` fields, plus connected profiles'
per-stream `compressedRequested`, so automation can assert that the process
launched with the intended diagnostic mode and then separately check
`compressedObserved`. Kiwi profile `state` may also report
`busy`, `waiting`, `camping`, or `camp_disconnected`; the profile `metadata`
object includes typed busy/camping fields such as `campStatus`,
`campReceiverChannel`, `campQueuePosition`, `campQueueWaiters`, and
`campQueueReloadRecommended` when the server reports them.

On macOS, do not host the bridge from a Codex-style sandboxed command. The
native Cocoa platform can abort during `QApplication` startup if pasteboard or
HIServices are unavailable, before AetherSDR reaches the automation bridge; with
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, the same sandbox can still deny the `QLocalServer`
socket the bridge needs. When the MCP wrapper is configured, prefer its secure
[`app_instance`](#secure-fresh-build-handoff) launch. For a manual launch, run
outside the command sandbox instead:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen AETHER_AUTOMATION=1 ./build/AetherSDR.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherSDR &
```

## MCP server — drive the bridge from any AI assistant

`tools/aether_mcp.py` wraps this bridge in the Model Context Protocol, so
an MCP-capable coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex CLI,
Gemini CLI, …) can validate your PR against the running app natively —
no socket scripting required. This is the recommended way for
contributors to self-verify UI changes before requesting review.

**Setup** (zero dependencies — plain Python 3):

1. Register the server with your assistant:
   - **Claude Code**: nothing to do — the repo's `.mcp.json` registers it;
     approve the prompt on first use. (Manual: `claude mcp add aethersdr
     -- python3 tools/aether_mcp.py`)
   - **Cursor / Windsurf / others**: add to your MCP config:
     ```json
     {"mcpServers": {"aethersdr-automation": {
        "command": "python3", "args": ["tools/aether_mcp.py"]}}}
     ```
   - **Windows**: use `python` (or `py -3`) instead of `python3`.
2. Launch through `app_instance` (recommended for a fresh proof build), or
   manually with `AETHER_AUTOMATION=1 ./build/AetherSDR`.

**Tools exposed** (25 typed tools): process handoff — `app_instance`;
introspection — `bridge_status`,
`dump_tree` (with a `filter` arg), `grab_widget` (PNG inline; optional
`path` for where the PNG is written, else a temp file),
`get_state`, `get_log`, `floors`, `streams`; driving — `invoke`, `gesture`
(on a target-not-found failure it appends `did_you_mean` candidates),
`shortcut`, `tune`, `slice`, `pan`, `record`, `mark`, `window`, `menu`;
assert/await — `assert_state` / `wait_for` (read a model property and
check/await a value — validation reads as pass/fail, not a manual diff);
connection — `connect` / `disconnect`; audio — `capture_audio`; and
`bridge_command` (raw escape hatch for everything else).

The verbs kept behind `bridge_command` on purpose: the low-level widget
primitives (`close`, `hover`, `tooltip`, `scrollTo`, `drag`, `showMenu`,
`contextMenu`, `rightClick`, `hitTest`, `clickAt`, `doubleClick`,
`doubleClickAt` — `invoke`/`grab` cover the common cases), the transmit-keying verbs (`key`, `txtest`,
`atu`, `cwx`, `testtone`, `txwaterfall`, `transmit` — gated by
`AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX`, deliberately less convenient), and the
niche/complex ones (`dss`, `layout`, `scale`, `panmessage`, `tci`,
`station`, `resize`, `qrz`).

**Prompts and resources.** The server also exposes an MCP **prompt**,
`validate_ui_change` (the loop below as a guided workflow — pass your
`widget` and `change`), and read-only **resources** that pull live state
as context without a tool round-trip: `aethersdr://widget-tree`,
`aethersdr://state/radio`, `.../slices`, `.../pans`, `aethersdr://verbs`.

A typical assistant validation loop for a PR:
`bridge_status` → `dump_tree filter=<your widget>` → `invoke` the
control you changed → `assert_state` / `wait_for` on the model property
that should have changed → `grab_widget` for a visual check.

**Access token.** Enabling the bridge in Radio Setup → Network mints a
random token (stored in your OS secret store via QtKeychain — macOS
Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / libsecret-KWallet, never in the
settings store — RFC #4603 bans credentials from it outright). Make it
available as `AETHER_MCP_TOKEN` only in the shell session that launches
your assistant, using a secret-safe input method that does not record the
value in shell history. `tools/aether_mcp.py` inherits it from the parent
process environment automatically, so no file needs to carry it. **Do not**
put the literal token in a shell profile or add an `env` block to `.mcp.json`
(or any other MCP config file) — those put a live credential on disk instead
of keeping it in your OS keychain and risk it landing in a commit. The bridge
rejects every verb except `ping` without a matching token. Headless/CI can
supply the token via `AETHER_MCP_TOKEN` directly, which overrides the keychain.

### Secure fresh-build handoff

Use the typed MCP `app_instance` tool when the MCP wrapper already has
`AETHER_MCP_TOKEN` from a secure runtime source (for example macOS Keychain,
Credential Manager, or libsecret) but a newly built app has a different secret-
store requester identity:

```json
{"action":"launch","worktree":"/absolute/path/to/AetherSDR","label":"issue-4354-proof"}
```

`worktree` must be an absolute AetherSDR Git worktree. The wrapper runs only its
canonical `build/AetherSDR` artifact (`build/AetherSDR.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherSDR`
on macOS), directly without a shell. It passes the wrapper token only in the
child process environment using the app's existing `AETHER_MCP_TOKEN` runtime
override; the token is never a command-line argument, MCP result, discovery
field, log message, or settings value.

Each launch gets a unique explicit local socket and safe label. The wrapper
pins TX automation off with `AETHER_AUTOMATION_NO_TX=1`, removes any inherited
TX-enable flag, and refuses success unless token-free `ping` reports that auth
is required and authenticated `whoami` matches the exact child PID, socket, and
label with `txAllowed:false`.
All other MCP tools then target that owned socket. `status` inspects only the
owned process; `stop`, wrapper exit, or a failed launch terminates only that
process and releases its socket.

The tool fails closed if the wrapper has no token. It does not read, print, or
copy a secret from the app settings UI, so an assistant never needs to put the
credential in chat or a plaintext MCP configuration. Observe-only remains
operator-authoritative: if the saved setting is enabled, the launched instance
reports `readOnly:true` and mutating tools remain blocked.

What the token *does* and *doesn't* do: it opts a **specific** client in
and protects the secret at rest (nothing in a backed-up / synced /
screen-shared dotfile), across other user accounts, and over any network
reach. It is **not** a hard wall against a determined *same-user* process
on Linux/Windows — once your login keychain is unlocked, libsecret and
DPAPI hand the secret to any same-user caller (macOS, with its per-item
ACL prompt, is the exception). Treat it as "this app deliberately grants
this client access," not "same-user isolation."

The TX-safety gate is unchanged in spirit: the bridge refuses transmit-
keying controls regardless of who's calling (see [TX safety](#tx-safety)).
An assistant can only key your radio if **you** opt in — either by
launching with `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1`, or by checking **"Allow
TX via MCP"** in Radio Setup → Network. That checkbox raises a one-time
confirmation spelling out that automated software will be able to
transmit and that you, the operator, remain responsible for all
emissions; once confirmed the choice persists. Toggling it drives the
same `m_txAllowed` gate live. Enabling grants permission but does not claim
unrelated operator, DAX, or TCI transmissions; the force-unkey watchdog arms
when the bridge actually accepts a TX-capable action.

For proof-build process owners, `AETHER_AUTOMATION_NO_TX=1` pins this gate off
even when the operator preference was previously enabled. The Radio Setup
checkbox is disabled for that process and live attempts to enable it are
ignored. `app_instance launch` always sets this pin and verifies it through
authenticated `whoami` before returning success.

### Observe-only (read-only) mode

For a look-but-don't-touch session — handing an assistant visibility
without letting it change anything — check **"Observe only"** in Radio
Setup → Network. The bridge then refuses **every** mutating verb and
answers only pure-introspection reads (`ping`, `verbs`, `whoami`, `get`,
`dumpTree`, `grab`, `cell`, the read-only `log` actions, `floors`, the inventory-only
`streams` actions, and `hitTest`). In particular, it blocks `log set/reset`
and `streams reset/resync/refresh`; the latter two stream actions clear local
diagnostics or request a fresh radio inventory. It is
enforced in the app, not in the MCP server, so no client can flip it
off; the refusal message points the operator back to the checkbox. The
toggle takes effect immediately on a running bridge — no restart — so
the intended flow works: start the app with the bridge off, check
"Observe only", then start the bridge. `ping` and `whoami` report the
current state as `readOnly`, and the MCP server surfaces it in
`bridge_status` as `bridge_read_only`. Headless/CI runs can pin it with
`AETHER_AUTOMATION_READONLY=1`.

## How it works (the contract)

- **Transport:** a `QLocalServer` — an `AF_UNIX` socket on macOS/Linux, a named
  pipe on Windows. No TCP port, no network exposure.
- **Framing:** newline-delimited. You send one request per line; you get back
  exactly one compact-JSON response line.
- **Request line** is *either* a bare command or a JSON object — both work:
  - `dumpTree`
  - `grab SpectrumWidget /tmp/pan.png`
  - `{"cmd":"grab","target":"SpectrumWidget","path":"/tmp/pan.png"}`
  - `{"cmd":"grab","args":"SpectrumWidget /tmp/pan.png","token":"..."}`
    (the optional `args` string uses the same positional parser as a bare
    command, which is useful when authenticated requests also need a token)
- **Discovery:** on startup the app writes the resolved socket path to
  `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/aethersdr-automation.json`, so you never have to guess the
  platform-specific endpoint:
  ```json
  {"socket":"/var/folders/.../aethersdr-automation","name":"aethersdr-automation","pid":7326,"version":"26.6.3"}
  ```
  `tools/automation_probe.py` reads this automatically. Override the socket name
  at launch with `AETHER_AUTOMATION_SOCKET=<name>`.

### Driving it without the probe

Any language can talk to it; it's just a Unix socket and line-delimited JSON.
Raw shell example:

```bash
SOCK=$(python3 -c 'import json,os,tempfile; print(json.load(open(os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(),"aethersdr-automation.json")))["socket"])')
printf '{"cmd":"ping"}\n' | nc -U "$SOCK"
```

### `ping`
Connectivity / handshake, and which build is answering.

```json
→ {"cmd":"ping"}
← {"ok":true,"app":"AetherSDR","version":"26.9.3",
   "build":{"describe":"v26.9.3-68-g7e841682","sha":"7e841682",
            "baseline":"v26.9.3","commitsSinceTag":68,"dirty":false},
   "authRequired":false,"readOnly":false}
```

`version` is the release string, and a branch with unmerged changes reports the
same one as `main`. `build` tells them apart (#5804). It is `git describe --tags
--always --dirty`, captured when the binary is **built**, not when CMake was
configured, so it cannot name an older commit after an incremental rebuild.
`dirty` is `git describe`'s own notion: tracked files differed from `HEAD` at
build time. Outside a git checkout (a source tarball) the strings are
`"unknown"` and `commitsSinceTag` is `-1`; when no tag is reachable (a shallow
clone), `describe` and `sha` carry the bare hash, `baseline` is `"unknown"` and
`commitsSinceTag` is likewise `-1`.

### `verbs`
Machine-readable catalog of every verb the running build understands —
canonical name, aliases, and a one-line help string, straight from the server's
verb registry (#4174). Use it instead of hand-maintained verb lists in drivers;
`tools/automation_probe.py` passes any verb not in its own mapping table
through as a bare line, so new simple verbs work in the probe with no probe
changes.

```json
→ {"cmd":"verbs"}
← {"ok":true,"count":45,"verbs":[
    {"name":"ping","help":"liveness check → app + version"},
    {"name":"drag","aliases":["mouse"],"help":"drag <target> <dx> <dy> — synthesize press→move→release"},
    …]}
```

### `dumpTree`
ARIA-style semantic snapshot of **every** top-level `QWidget` hierarchy. This is
your "DOM snapshot" for controls.

```json
→ {"cmd":"dumpTree"}
← {"ok":true,"roots":[ <node>, <node>, … ]}
```

A widget that is itself a window — a floated pan, a dialog, a popup menu —
appears exactly once, as a **root**, never nested under its `QObject` parent
even when it has one. Walk `roots` to find them; do not expect to reach a
floated pan (or a parented context menu) by descending from `MainWindow`.

Each `<node>`:

```jsonc
{
  "class": "AetherSDR::SpectrumWidget",   // C++ class (full, namespaced)
  "objectName": "masterVolume",            // present only if set
  "accessibleName": "Master volume",       // present only if set
  "toolTip": "Clear the displayed SWR sweep trace.",  // present only if set
  "enabled": true,
  "visible": true,
  "cursor": "pointinghand",                // present only if the widget owns a cursor (WA_SetCursor); shape name — see below
  "geometry": { "x": 1, "y": 104, "w": 1448, "h": 751 },  // GLOBAL screen coords
  "windowState": "maximized",              // top-level windows only: normal|maximized|minimized|fullscreen

}
```

The `range` lets a driver validate against the real bounds (scale) and detect
**circular/wrapping** controls without guessing: if `setValue(max)` doesn't stick
but a mid value does, the control wraps (e.g. a 0–360° phase slider where step 72
≡ 0°) — classify it as wrapping, not broken.

**The `value` field** is the fast path for state assertions — it's filled in
for common controls so you can assert without a screenshot:

| Widget | `value` |
|---|---|
| `QAbstractSlider` (sliders, scrollbars, dials) | numeric position, e.g. `"42"` |
| `QAbstractButton` checkable (checkbox, toggle) | `"checked"` / `"unchecked"` |
| `QAbstractButton` non-checkable (push button) | its text |
| `QComboBox` | current text |
| `QLineEdit` | current text |
| `QSpinBox` / `QDoubleSpinBox` | numeric value |
| `QProgressBar` | numeric value |
| `QLabel` | its text |
| `QTextEdit` / `QPlainTextEdit` (transcripts, decode logs, consoles) | plain text, capped at 2048 characters with a trailing `…<truncated>` marker; the `dump_tree` node also carries `valueTruncated: true` when cut (the cap itself applies wherever `value` is reported, including `invoke`'s `newValue` echo, which carries only the in-band marker) — use [`text`](#text) for the full document |
| `QAction` inside a `QMenu` | label text, or `"checked"` / `"unchecked"` for checkable actions |
| containers / custom-painted surfaces | omitted |

`QMenu` nodes also expose their `QAction` entries as action objects under
`actions` and as synthetic `children`, so popup menus can be inspected while
another request is blocked inside `QMenu::exec()`. Action objects include the
display `text`, check state, enabled/visible state, global `geometry` when the
menu is visible, and metadata such as `toolTip`, `statusTip`, and `data` when
present.

**Extra observable fields** (all non-destructive — no control is stepped):

- `toolTip` — any widget's hint text, so distinctions that live only in the
  tooltip are assertable (e.g. two "Clear" buttons: *Clear all bookmarks* vs
  *Clear the displayed SWR sweep trace.*).
- `items` + `currentIndex` — a `QComboBox`'s full option list and active index,
  so you can verify the available choices without stepping (and applying) each
  selection.
- `panIndex` — a `SpectrumWidget`'s pan index in a multi-pan layout; pass it to
  `grab pan <index>` or `pan close <index>`.
- `windowState` — on top-level windows: `normal` / `maximized` / `minimized` /
  `fullscreen`, so a `window` action (or a manual maximize) is assertable.
- `text` + `checked` — on a **checkable** button, the label and an explicit
  boolean state. `value` alone reports only `"checked"`/`"unchecked"`, which hid
  *which* control it was (e.g. the six DSP method buttons NR2…BNR all read
  `"checked"`); `text` restores the identity.
- `noiseFloorDbm` / `displayFloorDbm` — a `SpectrumWidget`'s live measured floors
  (the same values [`floors`](#floors) returns), for numeric floor assertions.
- `gaugeLabel` / `gaugeValue` / `gaugeRange` / `gaugeTicks` — an `HGauge`'s
  centred bar label, current numeric value, scale (`min`/`max`/`redStart`/`yellowStart`),
  and tick labels. `HGauge` is a custom-painted widget with no `Q_OBJECT`, so it
  otherwise serializes as a bare `QWidget` carrying only its `accessibleName`;
  these fields make the horizontal bar gauges (PA temp / supply / fan on the
  Radio Hardware applet, and the TX SWR / forward-power / ALC / mic / compression
  meters) numerically assertable — e.g. proving the MtrApplet °C↔°F toggle
  switches the PA-temp scale from `0–120` (ticks `0,30,55,70,90,120`) to `32–248`
  (ticks `32,86,131,158,194,248`) and updates the live overlay text, without a
  screenshot. Published only under `AETHER_AUTOMATION` (zero cost otherwise).
- `gaugeFraction` — the `[0,1]` fill an `HGauge` **actually paints**, after
  ballistics. Every field above it is an *input*; this is the *derived* state,
  and the two can disagree. That is not hypothetical: until #4636, `setRange()`
  moved the axis without re-mapping the fill, so a gauge on a steady reading
  painted the old fraction against the new scale indefinitely — an ACOM
  reflected-power bar showed **206 W for 120 W** while `gaugeValue`, `gaugeMin`
  and `gaugeMax` all read correct, so a `dumpTree` assertion passed with the
  defect fully present. Prefer `gaugeFraction` whenever you are asserting what
  the operator can *see*; use `gaugeValue` for what the widget was *told*.
  Two caveats: it tracks the animation, so read it once the bar has settled
  (`setValueImmediate` and `setRange` snap; `setValue` sweeps over
  ~30 ms attack / 180 ms release), and on a **reversed** gauge
  (`setReversed`, e.g. the compression bar) the painted width is
  `1 - gaugeFraction` because min means a full bar there.
- `cursor` — the widget's mouse-cursor **shape name**, reported only when the
  widget explicitly owns a cursor (`WA_SetCursor`); inheriting widgets omit it.
  Lets a driver assert **hover affordance** — a clickable control carries
  `pointinghand`, a text field `ibeam` — without observing the live OS cursor,
  which no `grab`/screenshot captures. Shape names: `arrow`, `pointinghand`,
  `ibeam`, `splith`, `splitv`, `sizehor`, `sizever`, `openhand`, `forbidden`,
  `wait`, `busy`, `cross`, `blank`, … (`other` for anything unmapped). Used to
  prove every interactive slice-flag field now signals clickability (#4036).

### `grab`
PNG capture of a single widget.

```json
→ {"cmd":"grab","target":"SpectrumWidget","path":"/tmp/pan.png"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"SpectrumWidget","class":"SpectrumWidget",
   "path":"/tmp/pan.png","width":2896,"height":1502,"bytes":2248854}
```

- `path` is optional. If omitted, the PNG is written to
  `${TMPDIR}/aether-grab-<target>.png` and the path is returned.
- The panadapter is a GPU (`QRhiWidget`) surface; the bridge does the correct
  framebuffer readback for it, so the capture is the *real* rendered spectrum,
  not a blank.
- **The panadapter message overlay is *not* in this framebuffer.** Connection
  status cards (e.g. the KiwiSDR "Not connected" card), interlock
  "Transmit disabled" warnings, and anything posted via [`panmessage`](#panmessage)
  are a sibling widget stacked over the surface — they are captured only by
  `grab pan-visible <index>`, never by `grab SpectrumWidget` / `grab pan <index>`.
  A flow that verifies disconnect/interlock state from a framebuffer grab will
  silently pass on a broken connection; use `grab pan-visible` (or read
  `panmessage list`) for that state.

**`grab pan <index> [path]`** captures a *specific* pan's raw spectrum surface
in a multi-pan layout, keyed on the `panIndex` from `dumpTree`. Plain
`grab SpectrumWidget` always resolves the first one, so it can't reach pan 1+.
This is the GPU framebuffer only; child overlays such as VFO flags are not part
of this image.

```json
→ {"cmd":"grab","target":"pan","selector":"1","path":"/tmp/pan1.png"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"pan1","class":"SpectrumWidget","panIndex":1,
   "path":"/tmp/pan1.png","width":2280,"height":686}
```

**`grab pan-visible <index> [path]`** captures the operator-visible pan applet,
including the indexed pan's spectrum surface and child overlays such as VFO
flags. Use this for screenshots of what the user sees. `pan-composite` is an
alias.

```json
→ {"cmd":"grab","target":"pan-visible","selector":"1","path":"/tmp/pan1-visible.png"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"pan-visible1","class":"PanadapterApplet","panIndex":1,
   "surfaceClass":"SpectrumWidget","path":"/tmp/pan1-visible.png",
   "width":2280,"height":710}
```

An unknown index returns `{"ok":false,"error":"no pan with index N","available":[0]}`.

### `invoke`
Drive a control deterministically — no pixel-hunting. Resolves `target` exactly
like `grab`.

```json
→ {"cmd":"invoke","target":"Master volume","action":"setValue","value":"35"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"Master volume","class":"QSlider","action":"setValue","newValue":"35"}
```

`newValue` echoes the control's state *after* the action (same field `dumpTree`
reports) — a free round-trip confirmation.

**Disabled controls are refused.** Qt's `setValue()`/`setChecked()` still mutate
a *disabled* widget, so without a guard the bridge would report a happy
`newValue` while the radio never sees the change (the control is greyed out for
a reason — wrong mode, not connected, …). `invoke` on a disabled widget returns
`{"ok":false,"disabled":true,"error":"refused: '…' is disabled …"}` instead, so
the no-op is an explicit, assertable signal.

| `action` | applies to | `value` |
|---|---|---|
| `click` | any `QAbstractButton` | — |
| `toggle` | any `QAbstractButton` (checkable → toggle, else click) | — |
| `setChecked` | checkable button | `true`/`false`/`on`/`off`/`1`/`0` |
| `setValue` | slider / scrollbar / spinbox | integer (or number for double-spin) |
| `wheel` | any visible widget | one wheel notch: `-1` or `1` |
| `setText` | `QLineEdit` | the text (side-effect-free — does **not** submit) |
| `submit` | `QLineEdit` | optional text, then fires `returnPressed` (retune / login / send) |
| `setCurrentText` | `QComboBox` (item text) / `QTabBar` (tab label, case-insensitive — reaches deferred setup-dialog tabs) | text |
| `setCurrentIndex` | `QComboBox` / `QTabBar` | integer index |
| `selectRow` | `QAbstractItemView` (`QTableWidget`/`QTreeWidget`/`QListWidget`) | integer row index |
| `showPopup` / `hidePopup` | `QComboBox` — holds the drop-down open under bridge control (deferred to a clean main-loop turn, like `showMenu`); the open container is named `aetherComboPopup` so a follow-up `grab_widget aetherComboPopup` / `dump_tree` lands on it instead of a hidden sibling. The name is valid **only while the popup is open** — it is cleared on `hidePopup` and when the list closes on its own (item pick, Esc, click-away) — so grab before hiding; a stale name is never left behind | — |
| `trigger` / `click` / `toggle` | visible `QMenu` `QAction` | — |
| `setChecked` | checkable visible `QMenu` `QAction` | `true`/`false`/`on`/`off`/`1`/`0` |

Combo selection refuses disabled items. `setCurrentIndex` also rejects invalid or out-of-range combo indices (`-1` still clears the selection); `setCurrentText` rejects missing items on non-editable combos. Editable combos still accept free text. These boundary checks report unreachable requests instead of claiming success and keep automation from bypassing capability-disabled choices.

**`submit` vs `setText`.** `setText` only sets the field — deliberately
side-effect-free, because several bridge-reachable fields wire irreversible
actions to `returnPressed` (SmartLink login, manual-connect host, DX-cluster
send). `submit` is the explicit opt-in that sets (optional) then fires
`returnPressed` — use it to commit a frequency entry, a login, or a cluster
command.

**`selectRow`** selects a whole row in an item view (sets the current index
**and** a full-row selection), so a dialog's row-scoped buttons (Tune / Edit /
Remove / Disable) — which read the view's current row or selection — become
drivable; plain `invoke click` on those buttons is a no-op until a row is
selected. The reply echoes `selectedRow` and `selectedRowText` (first-column
text) as the round-trip confirmation. Row index is **order-sensitive**:
re-`dumpTree` (or re-read) after any sort, filter, or insert.

```json
→ {"cmd":"invoke","target":"Scheduled nets","action":"selectRow","value":"0"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"Scheduled nets","class":"QTableWidget","action":"selectRow",
   "selectedRow":0,"selectedRowText":"✓"}
```

**`showPopup` → grab → `hidePopup`** is the intended sequence for reading an
open drop-down (#5080). `showPopup` defers to a clean main-loop turn (reply is
`ok` + `deferred`), then names the open container `aetherComboPopup`; grab or
dump it under that name, then close. The name is held by exactly one open
popup at a time and only while it is open; an empty combo is refused up front
(`showPopup` would be a no-op and nothing would ever open).

```json
→ {"cmd":"invoke","target":"computeDeviceCombo","action":"showPopup"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"computeDeviceCombo","class":"QComboBox","action":"showPopup","deferred":true}
→ {"cmd":"grab","target":"aetherComboPopup"}
← {"ok":true,"class":"QComboBoxPrivateContainer","path":"…/grab.png", …}
→ {"cmd":"invoke","target":"computeDeviceCombo","action":"hidePopup"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"computeDeviceCombo","class":"QComboBox","action":"hidePopup","deferred":true}
```

### `get`
Read live model state — assert on truth without a screenshot. Requires a radio
model (present once the app is running; fields are empty until a radio
connects).

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"radio"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"radio","radio":{"connected":true,"connectState":"connected",
   "model":"FLEX-8400M","transmitting":false,"txPower":null,"sliceCount":1,
   "panCount":1, …}}

→ {"cmd":"get","model":"slice","selector":"active","property":"frequency"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"slice","property":"frequency","value":3.6}
```

| `model` | `selector` | returns |
|---|---|---|
| `audio` | — | audio-engine snapshot (RX/TX stream state, mute, buffer counters, Opus TX pacing counters, KiwiSDR TX mute gate, Receive Presentation output-signal counters) |
| `dsp` | — | client-side AetherDSP noise-reduction state, **plus a `backend` object** carrying the backend-owned DSP read-back (`family` and a `chains` list, each entry naming its `chain` and its `level`) when the active backend reports one — see [`get dsp`](#get-dsp) |
| `radio` | — | radio snapshot (name, model, version, connected, **connectState**, fullDuplex, transmitting, txPower, paTemp, slice/pan counts) — see [`connectState`](#connectstate). `txPower` (measured forward power, Watts, **display-smoothed** — the same number as `get meters`.`fwdPower`; `get meters`.`fwdPowerInstant` is the unsmoothed sample, which is what a gate reading back a drive change wants) and `paTemp` are **null** unless a live sample says otherwise; neither reports a fabricated zero. The operator's requested drive is `get transmit`.`rfPower`, which is a different quantity. |
| `gps` | — | GPS status, backend-normalized `positionValid` and `source`, tracked/visible counts, grid, radio-format coordinates, altitude, speed, course, UTC time and date, frequency error, the Flex-hosted `ntpServerAddress`, the radio-owned NTP client state (`ntpClientEnabled`, `ntpClientServer`, `gpsTimeCorrection`, `ntpSyncStatus` — IC-705), and oscillator-reference state. This authenticated diagnostic response contains precise location data; the compact status bar and tooltip do not. |
| `transmit` | — | TX-chain snapshot: RF/tune power, mic/processor/monitor, VOX/AM/DEXP, TX filter, CW (speed/pitch/break-in/delay/sidetone/iambic mode/paddle swap/CWL/monitor gain+pan), ATU, APD. Validate that a TX/Phone/CW applet control reached the radio model. |
| `cwx` | — | CWX keyer + queue-drain watch — see [`get cwx`](#get-cwx) |
| `equalizer` (or `eq`) | — | 8-band RX+TX graphic EQ: `rxEnabled`/`txEnabled` and `rx`/`tx` band maps keyed by label (`63`…`8k`). Validate EQ-applet slider changes. |
| `meters` | — | `{all:[…]}` — every radio meter with `name`, `value`, `unit`, `low`/`high`, `description`, and **`age_ms`** (staleness): a meter that updates has small `age_ms` and a tracking `value`. The reply also carries a few scalars beside `all`. **`sLevel`** (S-meter, dBm) is **null** in three distinct cases and a client cannot tell them apart from the value: no receiver declares a LEVEL meter; **two or more do**, in which case the scalar has no single answer and `all` is where you name the receiver you mean; or the newest sample is older than the vitals window, which is **1500 ms** and is NOT the 2000 ms window `txMetersFresh` two keys away reports on. If you need a specific receiver's S-meter, read `all` — the scalar is a convenience for the single-receiver case and declines rather than guessing. |
| `slices` | — | array of all slice snapshots |
| `slice` | `active` (default) / `tx` / `<sliceId>` | one slice (sliceId, letter, frequency, mode, filterLow/High, **filterPresetId/filterPreset** for a radio-owned FIL slot, rxAntenna, nb/nr/anf + levels, **squelch/squelchLevel, agcMode/agcThreshold, apf/apfLevel**, **adaptiveFilterEnabled/adaptiveMinLowCut/adaptiveMaxHighCut/adaptiveMinSnr/adaptiveResponse/adaptiveSplatter/adaptiveActive** (SSB adaptive RX filter — `adaptiveActive` is the live AUTO-fit state), **linkedTo** (Slice Link peer id, `-1` when unlinked), txSlice, …) |
| `hostnb` | — (optional property) | HOST-SIDE noise blanker, read from the DSP: `{receivers:[{ddc,panId,on,level,threshold,requestedOn,requestedLevel,hasChain}]}`. **Distinct from `get slice nb`** — that reports the slice model, which is set the instant the button is clicked and stays true even if the intent never reached the DSP. `on`/`level` here are what the WDSP stage actually has; `requestedOn`/`requestedLevel` are what the backend was asked for, reported alongside so the two can be COMPARED. Errors on a radio that does not declare `hasHostNoiseBlanker` rather than returning an empty success. |
| `clock` | — | AetherClock snapshot: `state`/`stateName` (NoSignal/Acquiring/Locked), `station`/`stationName` (WWV/WWVH/WWVB), `decodedUtc` (ISO-8601, empty until a decode), `offsetMs` (decoded − host at the second edge; positive = host behind broadcast), `lockQuality` (0–100), `sliceId` (bound slice, −1 when stopped), `gpsTimeAvailable`. Validate applet Start/Tune/station-switch actions and lock progress without pixels. |
| `pans` | — | array of all panadapter snapshots |
| `pan` | `active` (default) / `<panId>` e.g. `0x40000000` | one pan (centerMhz, bandwidthMhz, min/maxDbm, rxAntenna, rfGain, fps, `transmitInhibited`, `transmitInhibitReason`) |
| `flags` (or `vfoFlags`) | `all` (default) / `<sliceId>` | VFO flag attachment snapshot: each flag’s slice id, expected radio pan id, attached UI pan id/index, geometry, visibility, and `attachedToExpectedPan`; also reports `missingSlices`. |
| `panstats` | `<panIndex>` / `<objectName>` (default: all) | per-panadapter render-cost counters — see [`get panstats`](#get-panstats) |
| `eqstats` | Client EQ canvas objectName (default: all) | analyzer paint/cache counters — see [`get eqstats`](#get-eqstats) |
| `tracedebug` | `<panIndex>` / `<objectName>` (default: all) | per-panadapter Flex/Kiwi FFT and 3D trace diagnostics — see [`get tracedebug`](#get-tracedebug) |
| `display` | `<panIndex>` / `<objectName>` (default: all) | per-panadapter **Display panel** settings — see [`get display`](#get-display) |
| `wavestats` | `—` / scope objectName | waveform-scope paint/append counters — see [`get wavestats`](#get-wavestats) |
| `clients` | — | connected-client roster, per-pan ownership, foreign dBm-write counters and evictions — see [`get clients`](#get-clients) |
| `dax` | — | DAX RX channel-ownership table — see [`get dax`](#get-dax) |
| `waveforms` | — | installed legacy/Docker waveforms, WFP state, local Digital Voice service/mode configuration and delivery metrics, raw radio `mode_list` values, duplicate counts, last maintenance response, and recent `waveform status` reports |

Add a trailing **property** name to any single-object form to get just that
field: `get slice active mode` → `{"value":"LSB"}`.

For `get audio`, `receivePresentationOutputSignalEmitCount` counts output
chunks dispatched to Receive Presentation Sync analysis, while
`receivePresentationOutputSignalSuppressedCount` counts non-empty output chunks
that were captured for automation but skipped because no KiwiSDR audio source
was active.

`opusTxPacing` reports the live remote-audio TX pacing queue:
`queueDepth`, lifetime `maxQueueDepth`, `packetsSent`, `catchUpPackets`, and
`droppedPackets`. A late audio-thread timer increments `catchUpPackets` when the
pacer repays missed 10 ms deadlines; `droppedPackets` must remain zero during a
healthy TX-mic run.

The TX input endpoint also exposes in-memory capture-health evidence for TCI
handoffs: `buffer_bytes_available`, `buffer_capacity_bytes`,
`source_was_active`, `saturation_observed`, `tci_suppressed_callbacks`,
`full_buffer_during_tci_observations`, `idle_during_tci_transitions`,
`post_tci_local_tx_while_saturated`, `capture_backlog_discards`,
`capture_backlog_discarded_bytes`, and `last_mic_read_age_ms`.
Capture is drained during TCI suppression on every platform — bounded blocks on
Linux/Windows pull mode, a push-buffer clear on macOS — so a growing
`buffer_bytes_available` value or a new saturation event now indicates that the
backend has stopped making forward progress. A non-zero
`capture_backlog_discards` means pull-mode capture had to skip stale audio to
return to realtime; during a healthy soak it stays at zero.
`saturation_observed` is set when the capture buffer reaches its reported
capacity during TCI suppression. An Active-to-Idle transition with suppressed
callbacks and unread bytes remains a fallback for backends that do not expose a
useful capacity. The same evidence is written to the Audio Summary support log
only when Help → Support's **TCI / CAT / rigctld** logging toggle is enabled;
TX capture-health summaries are off by default.

### `meterwindow`

`meterwindow start [duration_ms]` observes the connected radio's meters for a
bounded window (default 5000 ms, allowed 1–60000 ms). `meterwindow status` reads
progress; `meterwindow stop` closes it early and returns the final report.
Starting a second active window is refused. This verb never changes radio
controls or keys TX. Begin it at the point whose freshness you want to measure;
TX permission and unkey checks remain separate.

The report includes `active`, `startedAtMs`, `durationMs`, `observedMs`, and one
`meters` entry per observed meter, with its index, source, name, and native unit:

- `maxAgeMs`: greatest sample age observed during the window, including the age
  just before each replacement sample. A fresh reply cannot hide the preceding
  polling gap. A cached sample's starting age is included; an unfed meter has null.
- `receivedInWindow` and `firstSampleDelayMs`: distinguish a new sample from a
  cached value or a meter that never answered.
- `peakInWindow`: maximum converted value from samples timestamped within the
  window, with fractional precision. Pre-window values are excluded; no new
  sample means null. For meters declared in dBm this remains dBm, not watts.

Observations use MeterModel arrival timestamps, plus a 20 ms timer to measure
silence, and stop at the requested deadline even if a callback arrives late.
Equal-millisecond arrivals each contribute to the peak; cached observations
cannot discard a higher arrival with the same timestamp.
These measure delivery to the application, not the radio's internal sampling
clock. Disconnect stops the observation. Meter arrival hooks and the timer run
only while an explicit window is active.

`get meters` exposes `alc: {value, unit, ageMs}` in the native meter units.
Icom's ALC percentage is not a dBFS measurement. `swAlc` remains a legacy
normalized value for compatibility; use `alc` for physical readings. The
Phone/CW gauges use the native units, including percent on Icom, and retain
dBFS on Flex/HL2. IC-7300MK2 compression uses the guide's 0/15/30 dB calibration
points and a 30 dB face; other radio compression faces retain their old range.

`get meters.fwdPowerInstant` exposes unsmoothed watts. Native floating-point values retain
fractional watts through MeterModel; Flex wire decoding is unchanged. This
removes display-integer truncation, but adds no precision beyond the radio's
native meter resolution. Check `fwdPowerAgeMs` before treating it as current RF.

### `get cwx`
CWX keyer state, including the **queue-drain watch** that the #3949 fix relies
on. Firmware never emits `cwx queue=`, so the client detects a drained CWX buffer
by capturing the `radio_index` from the final `cwx send` reply and firing
`queueEmpty()` — which releases TX — once the live `cwx sent=` counter reaches the
batch end. `radio_index` is the batch's **first-char** queue position (verified on
FLEX-6500 fw 4.2.20.41343 — a 23-char send at `sent=48` replied `radio_index=49`
and `sent=` then climbed to 71), so `cwxEndIndex` is stored as
`radio_index + nChars - 1`. None of that state has a widget, so this is the only
non-hardware-poll way to assert the mechanism (cf. [`get dsp`](#get-dsp)).

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"cwx"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"cwx","cwx":{
   "active":true,"tracking":true,"cwxEndIndex":14,"sentIndex":6,
   "speed":25,"speedStep":5,"delay":5,"qsk":false,"live":false}}
```

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `active` | `RadioModel::cwxActive` — a `cwx send` batch is in flight (TX keyed for it) |
| `tracking` | `true` while a queue-drain watch is armed (`cwxEndIndex >= 0`) |
| `cwxEndIndex` | the batch-end index = `radio_index + nChars - 1`, the value `sentIndex` must reach to release TX (`-1` = idle) |
| `sentIndex` | the radio's live `cwx sent=` counter (last char keyed) |
| `speed` / `speedStep` / `delay` / `qsk` / `live` | keyer settings |

**The drain proof:** on a keyed macro, `cwxEndIndex` jumps to the batch-end N when
the send reply arrives, `sentIndex` climbs to N as the radio keys each char, and
the frame it reaches N `tracking` flips back to `false` and `active` clears
(queueEmpty → `xmit 0`). Watching `cwxEndIndex` hold while `sentIndex` climbs to
meet it — over the full keying duration, not after one char — is the direct
evidence the batch-end index is right (radio_index is the batch **start**, so the
end is `radio_index + nChars - 1`). ESC mid-macro ([`cwx stop`](#cwx) / `clearBuffer`) resets
`cwxEndIndex` to `-1` so an aborted macro never triggers a spurious release. A
trailing property narrows it: `get cwx cwxEndIndex` → `{"value":14}`. Fields are
zero/`-1`/idle until a radio connects.

`get waveforms localDigitalVoice` includes the local helper's lifecycle,
implemented mode descriptors, registration name/verification, exclusive active
slice, persisted service settings, nested D-STAR routing, and delivery telemetry:
`health`, `healthDetail`, `metricsMode`, `metricsValid`, `metricsAgeMs`,
`rxRateHz`, cumulative and latest-window `vitaGaps` / `inferredSourceBlocks`,
turnaround, queue depth, and metric generation/sequence. TX observations expose
`txMetricsValid`, `txMetricsAgeMs`, `txRateHz`, cumulative and latest-window
`txVitaGaps` / `txNullFrames`, PCM clip/invalid counts, send failures, queue
depth, and tail samples/time. Version 3 TX telemetry also exposes
`txPreRollFrames`, `txPreRollDelayMs`, `txAmbeQueueMax`, cumulative and latest
AMBE underflow/overflow/sequence errors, vocoder submit failures and pending
depth, plus drain frames/timeouts/discarded frames. These fields distinguish
true VITA transport loss from D-STAR source-block deficits and TX
encoder/pre-roll/drain faults.

The nested `dstar` object exposes the friendly `route` selection (direct or
repeater origin, local CQ/station/repeater-area/custom destination, callsigns,
and separate repeater module letters), detected `serialDevices`, the latest 100
timestamped RX/TX `traffic` entries, and the full persisted `trafficCount`.
These reads are passive. Use generic `invoke` against the named D-STAR tab
controls to test configuration; no D-STAR configuration control keys TX.

The complete snapshot also includes `rawModeLists` and
`maximumDstrOccurrencesPerSlice`. The latter must be `1` after a successful
registration migration; unlike the UI mode combo, these values are captured
before backend deduplication.

### `waveform` - local service and registration maintenance

These actions never key the transmitter and do not require
`AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX`:

```text
waveform start dstar
waveform stop
waveform resync
waveform unregister <safe-registration-name>
```

`unregister` returns as soon as the command is queued. Poll `get waveforms`
until `lastCommand.pending` is false, require `lastCommand.code == 0`, then
poll the raw mode lists after the automatic slice-status resync. The verb is
generic; the bridge does not embed or preserve an old registration name.

### `get renderstats`

Combined rendering-analysis snapshot for before/after automation. It returns
every `panstats` entry, every WAVE/strip `wavestats` entry, every Client EQ
`eqstats` entry, the shared pan scheduler, and non-overlapping headline totals. The totals cover measured
GUI-thread FFT ingest, native/Kiwi waterfall ingest, GPU frame preparation,
software fallback painting, WAVE painting, and Client EQ painting. DSS timings are reported
separately because they are a subset of FFT/waterfall ingest.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"renderstats","selector":"reset"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"renderstats",
   "totals":{"panCount":1,"visiblePanCount":1,"waveScopeCount":1,
     "fftFramesPerSec":24.9,"gpuFramesPerSec":25.1,
     "fftIngestMsPerSec":4.2,"nativeWaterfallUpdateMsPerSec":3.8,
     "gpuFrameMsPerSec":2.7,"wavePaintMsPerSec":0.0,"eqPaintMsPerSec":1.1,
     "measuredMainThreadMsPerSec":10.7,
     "hiddenWaterfallUpdatesPerSec":0.0,
     "hiddenDssHistoryRowsPerSec":0.0,
     "waterfallAllocatedBytes":583680,
     "dssAllocatedBytes":37847040},
   "pans":[...],"scopes":[...],"eqCurves":[...],"renderScheduler":{...}}
```

Use `get renderstats reset`, wait for a fixed observation interval, then read
`get renderstats reset` again. This gives disjoint samples across pan, waterfall,
3DSS, scheduler, and WAVE counters with one command. `measuredMainThreadMsPerSec`
is instrumented GUI-thread work, not whole-process CPU percentage; use it for
causal comparisons while keeping the radio/display configuration fixed. As of
v26.8.1, the total includes Client EQ paint time; captures from older builds do
not include that component and are not directly comparable.

### `get eqstats`

Per-Client-EQ-canvas paint and cache counters. The bridge finds widgets by
`inherits("AetherSDR::ClientEqCurveWidget")`, so it includes both the base widget and the
interactive `ClientEqEditorCanvas` subclass used by the strip/editor. The
active strip canvas has a stable selector: `stripRxEqCanvas` or
`stripTxEqCanvas`. Those path-specific selectors name the same widget at
different times: before a path is selected it is `stripEqCanvas`, and switching
between RX and TX replaces its object name rather than creating another canvas.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"eqstats","selector":"stripTxEqCanvas","property":"reset"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"eqstats","curves":[{
   "name":"stripTxEqCanvas","visible":true,"widthPx":1920,"heightPx":1080,
   "dpr":2.0,"fftUpdatesPerSec":25.0,"paintsPerSec":25.0,
   "paintMsPerSec":1.1,"backgroundCacheRebuildCount":1,
   "responseCacheRebuildCount":1,"backgroundCacheHits":624,
   "responseCacheHits":624,"cacheEligible":true,
   "cacheLayerByteLimit":33554432,
   "cacheTotalByteLimit":67108864,"cacheRetainedBytes":66355200}]}
```

`get eqstats [selector] [reset]` returns then clears the selected interval
when `reset` is supplied. FFT-only paints should increase the hit counters
without increasing either rebuild count. Each retained layer is capped at
33,554,432 bytes (67,108,864 bytes across both layers); ordinary physical 4K
(3840×2160) layers remain eligible.
Above that size, the widget paints directly and releases any prior layer once,
instead of reallocating cache storage every paint.

### `get panstats`
Per-panadapter (SpectrumWidget) frame-cost counters — how much GUI-thread time
each pan spends preparing frames, split by pipeline section, for before/after
rendering-cost proofs without a profiler attach. Counters are always on and
cost a few integer adds per frame.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"panstats"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"panstats","pans":[{
   "panIndex":0,"renderMode":"2D","renderer":"GPU QRhi (Metal; Apple M1 Ultra)",
   "widthPx":2280,"heightPx":1302,"dpr":2.0,"sinceMs":60012,
   "fftFramesPerSec":29.6,"ingestMsPerSec":8.1,
   "gpuFramesPerSec":29.6,"gpuFrameMsPerSec":97.4,"avgGpuFrameUs":3290.0,
   "fftBuildMsPerSec":64.2,"fftVboBytesPerSec":42049536.0,
   "overlayRebuildsPerSec":0.1,"overlayRebuildMsPerSec":1.9,
   "overlayUploadBytesPerSec":3964928.0,"wfUploadBytesPerSec":18240.0,
   "paintsPerSec":0.0,"paintMsPerSec":0.0,
   "overlayDirtyCauses":{"smartMtr":2,"detect":1,"other":3}}],
   "renderScheduler":{"enabled":true,"requests":612,"flushes":301,
   "coalescedRequests":288,"avgWidgetsPerFlush":1.9}}
```

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `gpuFrameMsPerSec` | **the headline number** — main-thread ms consumed per wall-second preparing + encoding this pan's GPU frames |
| `ingestMsPerSec` | `updateSpectrum()` cost (EMA smoothing, noise floor, waterfall fallback pacing) |
| `fftBuildMsPerSec` / `fftVboBytesPerSec` | FFT trace resample + vertex bake cost and VBO upload volume |
| `overlayRebuilds*`, `overlayUploadBytesPerSec` | static-overlay QPainter repaints (should be ~0/s when idle) |
| `overlayDirtyCauses` | first-cause attribution for each overlay rebuild (`smartMtr`, `detect`, `other`) |
| `previewOverlayTransformsPerSec` | GPU-only remaps of the retained frequency-overlay texture during pan/zoom; these should not produce matching full-image rebuilds/uploads |
| `previewOverlayCommitRefreshes` | exact CPU overlay refreshes performed when pan/zoom previews commit |
| `previewScaleRefreshesPerSec`, `previewScalePaintMsPerSec`, `previewScaleUploadBytesPerSec` | narrow frequency-scale strip refreshes during preview; separates the small correctness update from full-pan overlay work |
| `wfUploadBytesPerSec` | waterfall texture upload volume |
| `nativeWaterfall*` / `kiwiWaterfall*` | source-specific ingest rate and GUI-thread cost; `HiddenUpdates` identifies background Flex/Kiwi work |
| `waterfallVisibleRows*` / `waterfallHistoryRows*` | viewport and retained compact-intensity-history write rates/cost (history is written only for the visible source) |
| `dssLiveRows*` / `dssHistoryRows*` | 96-row live 3D surface work versus deep retained scrollback work; `dssHiddenLiveRowsPerSec` exposes the hidden-Flex live-ring warming (#4081) — hidden sources retain no deep history |
| `waterfallAllocatedBytes` / `dssAllocatedBytes` | current plus cached Flex/Kiwi/profile storage; waterfall history is counted by actually allocated lazy chunks, not logical capacity |
| `paintsPerSec` / `paintMsPerSec` | software-QPainter path — always 0 in a GPU build, where `SpectrumWidget::paintEvent()` is not compiled at all (see README ▸ GPU Spectrum Rendering); non-zero only in a build configured `-DAETHER_GPU_SPECTRUM=OFF` |
| `renderScheduler` | shared panadapter repaint scheduler counters; `coalescedRequests` and `avgWidgetsPerFlush` show cross-pan request coalescing |

`selector` filters by pan index (`get panstats 0`) or objectName. `property`
`reset` zeroes the counters after the read so successive reads measure
disjoint intervals: `get panstats reset` resets all panes plus the shared
scheduler counters, and `get panstats 0 reset` resets one pane.

> **Removed field:** `leanMode` (boolean) was dropped when Lean Mode was
> removed from the app — scripts that keyed on it should stop; every pan now

### `get tracedebug`
Per-panadapter `SpectrumWidget` trace diagnostics for proving Flex/Kiwi display
source behavior without screenshots. This is intentionally diagnostic rather
than user-facing state: use it to compare the currently displayed source, hidden
background histories, separate 2D/3D trace positions, and the 3D floor anchor
used by the stacked trace renderer.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"tracedebug","selector":"0"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"tracedebug","pans":[{
   "panIndex":0,"name":"SpectrumWidget","renderMode":"3D",
   "kiwiWaterfallActive":false,
   "noiseFloorPosition":75,
   "flexNoiseFloorPosition":75,"kiwiNoiseFloorPosition":68,
   "dssFloorDepth":6,
   "flexDssFloorDepth":6,"kiwiDssFloorDepth":10,
   "dssFloorDbm":-120.5,"dssSpanDb":90.0,
   "flexDssRows":96,"kiwiDssRows":96,
   "kiwiFftTraceFloorDbm":-124.0,
   "kiwiDisplayFloorDbm":-110.0,
   "flexBins":{"count":768,"finiteCount":768},
   "kiwiBins":{"count":768,"finiteCount":768}}]}
```

`selector` filters by pan index (`get tracedebug 0`) or objectName. Key fields:

- `kiwiWaterfallActive` — whether this pan is displaying Kiwi spectrum/waterfall
  (`false` means Flex is displayed; audio and meters are separate concerns).
- `flexNoiseFloorPosition` / `kiwiNoiseFloorPosition` — the source-specific 2D
  trace position values restored when toggling displays.
- `flexDssFloorDepth` / `kiwiDssFloorDepth` — the source-specific 3D floor-depth
  values restored when toggling displays.
- `flexDssRows` / `kiwiDssRows` — rolling 3D history row counts for both display
  sources; useful for checking that hidden histories continue updating.
- `kiwiFftTraceFloorDbm` versus `kiwiDisplayFloorDbm` — distinguishes the FFT
  trace floor used by 3D placement from the waterfall color floor.

`get meters` additionally reports `temperature` and `voltage` observations with
`status`, `value`, `unit` and `ageMs`. `status` is one of `unsupported`,
`unreliable`, `never-fed`, `stale` or `fresh`; every status but `fresh` has a
null value, and a fresh zero is still a real reading. `unreliable` is the same
known-bad annotation `all[].reliable` carries, rejected here rather than
reported as a qualified reading. The freshness budget is 1500 ms, matching
`FRESH_MS` in `tools/tx_meter_test.py` (`MeterModel::kVitalsFreshMs`).
**The legacy `paTemp` and `supplyVolts` scalars are now nullable** — previously
they always carried a number, falling back to a `0.0f` initialiser for a sensor
the radio never reported. A consumer doing arithmetic on them must handle null. The legacy `paTemp` and `supplyVolts`
scalars carry those same qualified values, **and so does `paTemp` in
`get radio`, in the `connect wait` reply and in `radiocert persist`'s `radio`
block** — one snapshot gives one answer about one sensor. `alc` retains the
native unit and age; `swAlc` is a legacy conversion and must not be labeled
physical Icom dBFS.

`txtest twotone` is refused whenever the connected backend does not declare a
`twoToneGenerator` record. That is a capability, not a family check: only Flex has a
two-tone route (`transmit set tune_mode=two_tone`), while Icom's `setTune()` and
the HL2's built-in test tone at zero offset both produce a single carrier, so
accepting the verb there would certify two-tone RF that was never on the air.
The refusal comes before the TX gate — it is about what the evidence would
claim, so it applies even when `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1`. Ordinary TUNE
remains available in supported modes.

### `radiocert persist`

`radiocert persist` returns a **read-only persistence snapshot**, also allowed in
observe-only bridge mode. It does not enter the in-process tune/RX/TX runner,
change settings, force a save, or require an audio engine. It accepts no arguments.

The version-1 snapshot includes process/GUIClientID identity, settings-directory
identity, family and declared client-settings domain mask, radio/slice/pan state,
Display-panel presentation, client ownership and VFO attachment observations.
Display rows now carry `panId` so they can be joined to the live pan after a band
or session recreates objects. Pan snapshots also expose FFT average, weighted
average (with its known flag), waterfall rate (legacy name
`waterfallLineDuration`, **1..100, not milliseconds**, -1 unknown), center-known,
WNB and available RX antennas.

For Icom, `backendDiagnostics.result` also includes the read-only `civ scheduler`
payload. Its `stateFreshness` separates `transportConnected`, CI-V `identified`,
and `trackedStateReady`. The six tracked fields are selected-VFO frequency,
mode/DATA/filter tuple (decimal wire codes), squelch percent, AGC code, RF power
percent, and PTT. Each has a last decoded value, age, semantic key and status:
`never-confirmed`, `previous-context`, `stale`, or `confirmed`, plus two
independent booleans. **`pending`** means a write is in flight — it withholds
`trackedStateReady` but does not mask `status`, which keeps describing the last
confirmed value's age. **`accepted`** says the confirming frame was an accepted
observation; it is true everywhere except the one PTT case where a stale reply
agreeing with a pending unkey intent still publishes (Constitution VI forbids
suppressing a "still keyed" report) without being proof. A consumer citing PTT
as evidence of an unkey must require `accepted` and reject `pending`.
Only validated receive publications refresh these fields, including unchanged
replies. A setter or generic ACK cannot confirm them. Frequency/mode/filter
changes and outgoing VFO select/exchange invalidate the prior context; session
changes invalidate old observations. **Context invalidation is deliberately
coarser than the physical coupling:** a frequency change also sends `agcCode`,
`rfPowerPercent` and `ptt` to `previous-context`, which a frequency change
cannot actually affect. That is conservative rather than wrong — those fields
were last observed under a context that no longer holds — but it means
`trackedStateReady` flaps while an operator is tuning, and recovers only as
`onLinkTick` re-polls each field. Any readiness timing quoted from a **no-action
window does not describe a station in use.** The diagnostic age budget is 5000 ms and
does not change polling or authorize TX.

`trackedStateReady` is the conjunction of the fields whose per-field
`gatesReadiness` is true — frequency, mode/DATA/filter, AGC, RF power and PTT,
each of which `onLinkTick` reconciles on its own cadence. **Squelch is reported
but does not gate it.** `level::kSquelch` is re-polled only under the model
profile's `pollCwSquelchAndTxBandwidth`, which today only the IC-7300MK2 sets;
on every other Icom it is read once at connect, so requiring it made the
aggregate go false about five seconds into an IC-705 or IC-9700 session and stay
there. `squelchPercent` still ages to `stale`, and that is accurate — nothing
reconciles it on those models. Read `gatesReadiness` rather than assuming the
membership of this list. Fields outside this list, including
filter width and AGC threshold/off level, carry no freshness claim. CI-V has no
transaction identifiers, so delayed unsolicited data cannot prove physical
intent correlation or an unobserved front-panel VFO change with identical mode
and frequency.

The snapshot explicitly identifies its evidence as **client model and
presentation**. Some model setters update optimistically. Equality here alone
is neither independent wire readback nor proof of a durable disk commit.

The external supervisor runs the first receive-only Flex scenario set:

```sh
python3 tools/radiocert_persist.py plan
python3 tools/radiocert_persist.py run --app build/AetherSDR.app \
  --profile /tmp/persist-flex-profile --output /tmp/persist-flex-evidence \
  --serial EXACT_DISCOVERY_SERIAL --rx-antennas ANT1 ANT2
```

A separate opt-in scenario exercises two slices on one panadapter:

```sh
python3 tools/radiocert_persist_multislice.py plan
python3 tools/radiocert_persist_multislice.py run --app build/AetherSDR.app \
  --profile /tmp/persist-two-slice-profile --output /tmp/persist-two-slice-evidence \
  --serial EXACT_DISCOVERY_SERIAL
```

It starts with one owned USB/LSB slice and requires advertised capacity for two.
Both 14.180 and 14.160 MHz RX seeds must fit inside the original pan span. The
runner creates the additional slice, assigns distinct SQL, AGC, filter and audio
values, switches the selected slice, exercises SQL on/off isolation and independent
mode round trips, then performs a normal restart with both slices present. Radio
slice letters identify the contexts across restart; current numeric IDs, owned
slots and pan relationships are validated before mutations. The RX applet is
checked against the selected slice, while both slices' model values are sampled.

Only the test-created slice is removed/reopened. Original values are restored
only when the current state still matches the test's expected state. Production
slice reveal may move the pan center; its restoration also checks for conflicting
changes and compares MHz at Flex's six-decimal wire resolution. Any unsupported
topology or unresolved restoration stops with evidence retained. Successful runs
quit the owned client. The single-slice runner still rejects multiple slices by
default. Both persistence entry points disable TX permission; transmitting tests
use the separately authorized procedure in `docs/automation/TX_TEST_PROMPT.md`.

Use new, separate profile and output directories. The supervisor initializes
`AutoConnectToLastRadio=False` through the normal `--config` CLI before the first
GUI launch, selects the exact discovered serial, requires Available status and
one owned slice/pan with no other clients, and checks TX/ownership before every
mutation. The profile remains the same for the whole run; its deterministic
GUIClientID remains the same while the process PID and bridge endpoint change.
No settings CLI operation or forced save occurs between Quit and relaunch.
`AETHER_SETTINGS_DIR` also isolates legacy preference migration: it cannot
import native user preferences or move the ordinary profile's legacy XML.

The current plan seeds distinct 20m/40m FFT average/FPS and mode/filter tuples,
changes Grid and waterfall palette through real Display controls, checks mode
and BAND round trips, quits via the production Quit action, waits for process
exit, relaunches, and checks the entry context **before** revisiting both bands.
The optional `--rx-antennas ANT1 ANT2` explicitly authorizes receive-port changes:
seed different RX ports on each band, check retention across band/restart, and
exercise ANT1→ANT2→ANT1 on 20m. Omit it to keep RX antennas untouched. Both ports
must appear in the radio's published antenna list. TX antenna is an untouched sentinel. Slice mute has its own applet contract. A disconnected receive port is expected to be quiet; audio
liveness is not a persistence assertion. It samples 11 observations
across five seconds after readiness; any sampled mismatch remains a CONCERN even
if a later sample recovers. This is bounded evidence, not a promise that later
overwrites cannot happen.

`persist.json` is an atomic, write-ahead journal: pending actions and full
before-state are durable before sending commands, and ambiguous replies stop the
run without retrying a mutation. `persist.md` provides a scenario table. Outcomes
are ESTABLISHED at the named evidence layer, CONCERN, or INCONCLUSIVE; unfinished
scenarios remain listed as not run. The exit status reports runner completion
(0) or interruption (2), not a radio pass/fail grade.

Live Flex findings refined the supervisor: command/status logging starts before
connecting and is captured by process and sequence number alongside observations.
Any detected log gap is recorded explicitly; a gap cannot support a claim that
no intermediate write occurred. A seed model/presentation mismatch is retained
while independent transitions continue. Later matching samples remain
INCONCLUSIVE as a retention verdict until the seed/observation discrepancy is
resolved; their matching observation is recorded separately. A safety, identity,
ownership, topology or ambiguous-command failure still stops mutations.
Owned app processes run in their own process session so the shell completing a
report does not inadvertently terminate the client left open for inspection.

Cleanup restores seeded fields only when the current tested values still match
the last test intent. It restores a custom filter in the mode that was edited
before returning to the original mode. Mismatches are preserved for inspection,
not overwritten. Band-stack, frequency/span and other contextual side effects
are captured but are **not automatically undone** in v1. On interruption, inspect
`action-pending`, `band-baseline`, `mode-baseline` and the last snapshot before
manual recovery; the owned client may still be open. The runner never kills an
unresponsive client or falls back to another radio.

The expanded applet catalogue (`tools/radiocert_persist_applets.py`) exercises
40 non-keying setting contracts through scoped real widgets: RF/Tune setpoints,
slice volume/pan/mute, manual SQL intent, AGC mode/threshold, mic gain, processor,
phone monitor, AM carrier, VOX threshold/delay, downward expander, separate CW
monitor/delay/speed, and both complete eight-band radio EQ curves and enables.
Earlier seeds remain sentinels while later controls change. Band/mode/antenna
round trips, normal restart and guarded cleanup have separate observations.
A mode-specific or disabled control is an explicit coverage gap, never silently
force-enabled. VOX enable, tuning, MOX and transmitting must all be known false
before any mutation. Profile loads and keying/arming actions are excluded.

The `persist` snapshot additionally includes `transmit`, `equalizer`, `audio`
and `dsp` resources. Slice snapshots include manual SQL threshold, tuning step,
RIT/XIT and DAX channel; transmit snapshots include boost/bias and accessory/TX
delays. Observation does not imply that the corresponding UI scenario ran.
The JSON contains per-setting inventory, observability, action, widget-readback,
transition and cleanup evidence, plus explicit remaining domain gaps.

Pan snapshots distinguish dispatched FFT requests (`averageIsRequest`,
`fpsIsRequest`) from the last valid radio publications (`radioReportedAverage`,
`radioReportedFps`, -1 until published). Flex 4.2.18 can acknowledge these setters
without echoing status to the setting client. The model follows FlexLib's local
update on dispatch and always yields to subsequent radio status, including the
previous value. No timer or persistence replays the request. A dispatched value
is not a radio-confirmed value; the runner requires the radio-published FFT
values on context revisit and restart, including cleanup revisits.

A real-app, no-radio restart smoke check is available with `smoke` instead of
`run` (omit `--serial`); it uses Qt offscreen. The policy test
`radiocert_persist_policy` uses only in-process data fixtures and no radio peer.
Process supervision currently supports macOS/Linux. Icom mutation contracts,
additional antenna types, multiple slices/pans, MultiFlex, crash/power-cycle recovery,
DSP, memory banks and layout/audio-device scenarios remain explicit gaps for
subsequent iterations. The broader issue table and proposed contracts are in
[the persistence research](research/radiocert-persist-research-2026-09-07.md).

The two-slice runner also tracks `flexAgcOffLevel` independently from AGC
threshold, selects AGC Off before and after restart to check the shared RX
slider, and records each slice's FM entry/return before explicit cleanup.
Stable AGC/filter changes may be restored only after recording the original
retention result; peer changes, missing fields and unrelated drift stop the
run. The expanded FM/AGC matrix is locally policy-tested but awaits a live run.
See the [Flex-to-Icom handoff](research/persist-flex-to-icom-handoff-2026-09-08.md)
for completed evidence, remaining gaps and the IC-7300MK2 receive-only plan.
These mutation runners remain Flex-only; Icom AGC modes do not imply support
for Flex's AGC threshold/off-level controls.

### `get display`
Per-panadapter **Display panel** settings — every value the panel's PANADAPTER
/ WATERFALL / BACKGROUND / APPEARANCE / 3D VIEW groups own, as one flat object
per pan. Where `get tracedebug` is diagnostic internals, this is the operator's
own preferences, so a display change is assertable field-by-field instead of by
comparing screenshots.

   "freqGridSpacing":0,"freqScaleFontPt":8,"wfColorScheme":0,
   "spectrumRenderMode":0,"dssFloorDepth":6,"dssGain":70,"dssRowSpan":100,
   "kiwiWaterfallActive":false}]}
```

`selector` filters by pan index (`get display 0`) or objectName; omit it for
every pan. A trailing **property** narrows each entry to `panIndex`,
`objectName`, and that one field — `get display "" wfColorScheme` is the
one-line way to diff a palette across pans.

Field notes:

- `wfAutoBlackRadioSide` is the operator's stored **intent**;
  `effectiveWfAutoBlackRadioSide` is that intent masked by whether this radio
  computes a black level at all (#4606). They differ legitimately — assert the
  intent when checking what a preference action copied, the effective value when
  checking what renders.
- `backgroundImage` is `""` when the background is off entirely (the "Off"
  button), `:/bg-default.jpg` for the bundled logo, otherwise a file path.
- `dssFloorDepth` and `noiseFloorPosition` are stored per display source;
  `kiwiWaterfallActive` says which one these resolved from, so a Flex-vs-Kiwi
  mismatch reads as a labelled difference rather than a mystery failure.
- `fftAverage`, `fftFps`, `fftWeightedAvg` and `wfLineDuration` are
  radio-authoritative: the values here are what the widget last saw from radio
  status, and they settle a turn or two after a command.

**Proving "Clone to all Pans"** (Display panel → SYSTEM, above Reset to
Defaults) — change something on pan 0, clone, and diff:

```json
→ {"cmd":"invoke","target":"pan 0/displayColorSchemeCombo","action":"select","value":"2"}
→ {"cmd":"invoke","target":"pan 0/displayCloneToAllPansBtn","action":"click"}
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"display"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"display","pans":[
   {"panIndex":0,"wfColorScheme":2, …},
   {"panIndex":1,"wfColorScheme":2, …}]}
```

The radio-authoritative fields settle asynchronously, so re-poll rather than
asserting them in the same write as the click.

### `get rhi`
Per-panadapter `QRhiWidget` **surface geometry, color-buffer sizing mode, and
native-widget topology** — the widget size, devicePixelRatio, whether Qt owns
the color-buffer size, full-frame overlay/background textures, the waterfall
image/texture pair, and (on macOS) native-leaf/ancestor isolation. Automation
can assert automatic sizing under a fractional `QT_SCALE_FACTOR`, the separate
full-frame texture upload invariants from #4319, and the bounded native-view
hierarchy from #4339 in the same snapshot.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"rhi"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"rhi","pans":[{
   "panIndex":0,"name":"","visible":true,"widthPx":1100,"heightPx":455,"dpr":0.85,
   "gpu":true,"renderer":"GPU QRhi (D3D11; Intel(R) HD Graphics 520)",
   "rendererFailed":false,"rendererFailureReason":"",
   "colorBufferAutoSized":true,"colorBufferW":-1,"colorBufferH":-1,
   "overlayTextureW":936,"overlayTextureH":388,
   "backgroundTextureW":936,"backgroundTextureH":388,
   "waterfallTextureW":936,"waterfallTextureH":194,
   "waterfallImageW":936,"waterfallImageH":194,
   "waterfallTextureMatchesImage":true,
   "fullFrameTexturesEvenAligned":true}]}
```

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `dpr` | effective device-pixel ratio (fractional when `QT_SCALE_FACTOR` ≠ integer) |
| `rendererFailed` / `rendererFailureReason` | whether this panadapter's QRhi renderer failed and its recorded reason; a failed renderer reports `QRhi failed: ...` in `renderer` too. GPU builds only — omitted alongside the buffer fields when `gpu` is `false` |
| `colorBufferAutoSized` | `true` when the widget lets QRhiWidget auto-size (`fixedColorBufferSize` unset); this is the expected value |
| `colorBufferW` / `colorBufferH` | the unset sentinel `-1,-1` when auto-sized; any positive extent means a fixed buffer is active |
| `overlayTextureW/H` / `backgroundTextureW/H` | full-frame RGBA texture extents, or `-1,-1` before GPU initialization |
| `waterfallTextureW/H` / `waterfallImageW/H` | live GPU waterfall texture and retained CPU waterfall image extents |
| `waterfallTextureMatchesImage` | the CPU waterfall image fits within its GPU texture (texture ≥ image in both dimensions), so the upload is safe; holds across pop-out initialization even when the texture is floored larger than a small retained image (#4319) |
| `fullFrameTexturesEvenAligned` | both full-frame textures have even width and height (the #4319 upload-safety invariant), independent of the auto-sized QRhi color buffer |
| `nativeWindow` | macOS only: `true` when the `SpectrumWidget` currently has an actual native child window (`windowHandle()` exists); expected for the default Metal path and `false` with `AETHER_PAN_NO_NATIVE_WINDOW=1` |
| `nativeAncestorsBlocked` | macOS only: whether the leaf has `WA_DontCreateNativeAncestors`, preventing its native-window request from promoting the surrounding QWidget tree |
| `nativeAncestorCount` | macOS only: number of QWidget ancestors marked `WA_NativeWindow`; the isolated default Metal path expects `0` |

`selector` filters by pan index (`get rhi 0`) or objectName. On non-GPU builds
each entry reports `gpu:false` and omits the buffer fields. The three native
topology fields are emitted only on macOS; other platforms omit them.

For an automation-only QRhi failure check, launch with both
`AETHER_AUTOMATION=1` and `AETHER_AUTOMATION_FORCE_RHI_FAILURE=1`. The latter
keeps the platform's production QRhi API, presents only a blank clear pass, and
exercises AetherSDR's failure-reporting path; it has no effect unless automation
is enabled. Assert the per-pan `rendererFailed` state and the
`rhi.render-failed` panadapter message, then capture the composite pan surface
to confirm the warning card remains visible over the blank renderer. Production
QRhi failures enter the same reporting path through `QRhiWidget::renderFailed()`.

### `get clients`
Multi-session forensics (#3977/#3951): every client connected to the radio,
which of them have written **our** pans' dBm range, and which stale
predecessor sessions this client has evicted. `get pans` shows the symptom
(`minDbm` drifting between polls); this shows the culprit. Pan snapshots
(`get pan`/`pans`) also carry `clientHandle` + `ownedByUs` for ownership
assertions.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"clients"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"clients","evictionEnabled":false,
   "ourHandle":"0x443a5d3c","station":"Shack",
   "clients":[
     {"handle":"0x443a5d3c","station":"Shack","program":"AetherSDR","source":"","isUs":true},
     {"handle":"0x42ffe1c4","station":"Shack","program":"AetherSDR","source":"","isUs":false}],
   "foreignPanWrites":[
     {"handle":"0x42ffe1c4","dbmWrites":3,"lastPanId":"0x40000000",
      "lastMs":1783125692000,"evicted":true}],
   "evictedHandles":["0x42ffe1c4"]}
```

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `clients` | radio's client roster (from `sub client all`): handle, station, program, `isUs` |
| `foreignPanWrites` | per-handle tally of `min_dbm`/`max_dbm` status writes some OTHER client made against a pan whose radio-confirmed owner is us — the #3951 zombie signature |
| `evictedHandles` | stale same-station/same-program sessions whose `client disconnect` the radio **acknowledged** (confirmed, not merely attempted), via pan-reclaim or the 3-strike foreign-write rule |
| `evictionEnabled` | whether the 3-strike eviction may act. **Off by default** — detection and forensics always run; the force-disconnect requires `AppSettings["StaleSessionDefense"]` = `{"EvictionEnabled": true}`. The pan-reclaim eviction (scoped to our own pre-reconnect handle) is always active |

Counters and eviction marks are per-connection: they reset on disconnect,
because the radio recycles handle values across sessions.

Test recipe for session-fight classes of bugs: connect a second client to the
same pan (or replay `display pan set … min_dbm=…` from a raw TCP session —
see `tools/zombie_session_sim.py`), then assert `foreignPanWrites`
increments. With `EvictionEnabled` true and the offender's station+program
matching ours (it must be a **GUI** client to appear in the roster — a
`--bind-client-id` non-GUI zombie is tallied and logged but never evicted),
`evicted` flips true once the radio acknowledges the disconnect and the
offender's connection drops.

### `get dsp`
Client-side **AetherDSP** noise-reduction state — the counterpart to the
radio-side `nr`/`nb`/`anf` in `get slice`. There is no widget that exposes which
of the six AudioEngine NR modules is active and how it's tuned, so this is the
only non-screenshot way to assert it.

The response also carries **`backend`** — the backend-owned DSP configuration,
separate from AudioEngine's AetherDSP chain. For HL2, these DSP chains run
inside AetherSDR on the host, not in radio firmware (#5401).

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"dsp"}

```

- `active` — the name of the **one** enabled module (the modules are mutually
  exclusive), or `"none"`. There is **no** top-level `enabled` field.
- `methods.<NAME>` — `enabled` (engine state) and `available` (whether this build
  has the backend; `available:false` reflects a compile flag such as
  `HAVE_NVIDIA_AFX` (BNR) or `HAVE_DFNR`, so the button exists but is dimmed).
- `tuning` — per-module slider params: engine getters (`mnr`/`dfnr`) and the
  persisted `bnr` intensity, merged with the AppSettings-persisted
  NR2/NR4/DFNR-beta values. (BNR is the in-process NVIDIA AFX denoiser since
  #3902 — no container, so it exposes only `intensity`.)
- `backend` — **the backend-owned DSP read-back**. Everything above describes
  AetherDSP's chain in `AudioEngine`; this object describes the backend's
  separate DSP chains. For HL2, both `rx-wdsp` and `hl2-tx` run on AetherSDR's
  host I/O thread, so this is host DSP configuration, not firmware read-back.
  `family` is the connected backend's family (`"hl2"` above), and `chains`
  is a list with one entry per DSP chain that backend runs. It exists because
  the recurring defect on a new backend is model/DSP divergence — a control
  moves, the model records it, nothing reaches the DSP, and the symptom is "the
  control does nothing". Reading the requested values from `get slice` alone
  cannot prove that they reached the DSP; backend read-backs such as this object
  and `get hostnb` expose that distinction.
- `backend.chains[].chain` — **which** chain the entry describes: on a
  Hermes-Lite 2, `rx-wdsp` (WDSP on receive) or `hl2-tx` (the SSB transmit
  modulator, whose config is a different struct entirely). A backend may run
  more than one chain and they need not share a vocabulary, so key off `chain`
  rather than guessing from which fields are present. `rx-wdsp` entries also
  carry `receiver` — the **DDC index**, not a slice id.
- `backend.chains[].modulator` — **which transmit modulator this binary was
  built with**, on an `hl2-tx` entry: `wdsp-txa` (WDSP's TXA chain, selected
  by default on a fresh configure or explicitly with `-DAETHER_HL2_TX_TXA=ON`)
  or `phasing` (the in-tree fallback, selected with `-DAETHER_HL2_TX_TXA=OFF`).
  Existing build caches retain their configured choice. It is decided by the
  `AETHER_HL2_TX_TXA` compile flag and there is **no runtime switch** — the
  other chain is not in the process, so an operator cannot select the wrong
  one. It is reported because they can be running the wrong **build**, and a
  transmit report that does not say which modulator produced the signal is not
  actionable.
- On TXA entries, `level` is `channel-config` and `filterLowHz` / `filterHighHz`
  are the signed passband last accepted by the channel (negative for LSB/DIGL).
  `dspBlockSize` is the channel's DSP-rate size; `inputBlockSize` is its audio-rate
  size, and `dspRateHz` names the DSP rate. Refused requests leave applied values unchanged. Phasing entries retain
  `dsp-config` and audio-domain positive passband magnitudes.
- `wdspChannelId`, `modulatorBlocks`, `modulatorFaultBlocks` — present only
  when the modulator has a WDSP channel behind it (so, `wdsp-txa` only).
  `modulatorFaultBlocks` counts blocks the modulator could not place on the
  wire, and is present **even at zero**: "no blocks were dropped" and "nobody
  counted" must not look the same. Non-zero means the modulator is being fed
  faster than it can drain, or has stalled; it is logged on `aether.hl2.tx`
  at the same moment.
- `backend.chains[].level` — **how close to the DSP the values came from**.
  "Read-back" is used loosely, and the difference decides what a mismatch
  proves:
  - `channel-config` — what the channel was **opened** with, after any clamping
    or refusal. One level below the model and one above a query into WDSP
    itself. Within this entry, `wdspNotchCount` and `appliedNoiseBlanker`
    are exceptions: they query WDSP directly.
  - `dsp-config` — the DSP's **own state**.
  - `not-configured` — a chain that **exists with nothing behind it**. Reported
    present-but-unconfigured rather than omitted, and deliberately **without**
    the configuration fields, so there are no stale or default values to
    mistake for a real setting: a receiver with no channel behind it, or a
    transmit chain that has never been configured, refused its `configure()`, or
    been torn down by a disconnect, is exactly the state worth seeing.
- **`dsp-config` describes the DSP, not the wire.** It is not liveness and not
  keying. Normal unkeying and transient link loss retain the applied
  configuration and still report `dsp-config`; for link state read
  [`connectState`](#connectstate) on `get radio`.
- **`backend` is absent entirely when the gather is empty.** No backend
  attached, a backend that does not implement the read-back, and a gather that
  could not be made all produce **no `backend` key at all** — never an empty
  object and never an empty `chains` list, because an empty object would read as
  "we asked, and the answer is nothing". `get dsp backend` errors with
  `unknown property 'backend' for dsp` in exactly the cases the bare form omits
  it. **A caller must not read the absence as "this radio has no chains"** — it
  means the question went unanswered, which is a different fact. Both directions
  are pinned by `tests/automation_dsp_backend_readback_test.cpp`.
- A trailing property narrows it: `get dsp active` → `{"value":"NR2"}`, and
  `get dsp backend` returns the identical object the bare form reports. The
  read-back is merged into the snapshot **before** the property branch for that
  reason: `assert_state` and `wait_for` only ever issue property reads, so a
  field reachable only from the bare form is a field no automation client can
  assert on.

### `get wavestats`
Per-scope paint/append counters from every `WaveformWidget` instance — the
sidebar WAVE applet (`waveAppletScope`) plus the Aetherial strip's TX/RX
waveform panels (`stripWaveformScope`). This is the no-profiler way to prove a
rendering-cost change: `paintMsPerSec` is the main-thread paint budget the
scope actually consumed, in milliseconds per wall-clock second.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"wavestats"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"wavestats","scopes":[{
   "name":"waveAppletScope","windowTitle":"AetherSDR","windowClass":"AetherSDR::MainWindow",
   "floating":false,"visible":true,"tx":false,"paused":false,
   "mode":"Scope","fps":60,"windowMs":1000,"sampleRate":48000,
   "widthPx":244,"heightPx":110,"nativeWindow":false,
   "nativeAncestorsBlocked":false,"nativeAncestorCount":0,"sinceMs":40012,
   "paintCount":2381,"paintsPerSec":59.5,"avgPaintUs":312.4,"maxPaintUs":1893,
   "paintMsPerSec":18.6,"appendsPerSec":124.9,"samplesPerSec":47980.1}]}
```

- `paintMsPerSec` — `avgPaintUs × paintsPerSec / 1000`; the headline number.
- `mode` uses the applet's UI names: `Scope` / `Envelope` / `History` / `Bands`.
- `floating` + `windowClass` — which top-level surface hosts the scope
  (`MainWindow` docked, `FloatingContainerWindow` popped out, or the strip).
- `nativeWindow`, `nativeAncestorsBlocked`, and `nativeAncestorCount` expose
  the same QWidget/native-surface topology as `get rhi`. On macOS, waveform
  scopes embedded in scroll areas are expected to remain composited
  (`false`, `false`, `0`) so their rendering follows QWidget resize, scroll,
  and clipping geometry.
- Counters accumulate from app start; a selector narrows to one scope
  (`get wavestats waveAppletScope`) and the pseudo-property `reset` zeroes
  the counters after the read (`get wavestats "" reset`) so successive reads
  measure disjoint intervals.
- Hidden scopes keep counting appends (the data feed stays live) but never
  paint — `paintsPerSec` 0 with a nonzero `appendsPerSec` is the expected
  hidden-widget signature, not a bug.

### `get hostnb`
The host-side impulse noise blanker, answered by the **backend** rather than by
the slice model. Only meaningful on a radio that declares
`hasHostNoiseBlanker` — currently HL2 and ANAN. Both run WDSP's ANB on
this host ahead of demodulation. The bridge asks `nb.get` in the selected
backend's extension namespace (`hl2` or `anan`); it does not infer applied
state from the slice button.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"hostnb"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"hostnb","hostnb":{"receivers":[
   {"ddc":0,"panId":"0x40000000","on":true,"level":80,"threshold":7.579,
    "requestedOn":true,"requestedLevel":80,"hasChain":true}]}}
```

- **Why it is not `get slice nb`.** That field comes from `SliceModel`, which
  is set the moment the operator clicks NB — it is true whether or not the
  intent survived the seam. A backend that ignored `setSliceNoiseBlanker`
  entirely would still report `nb: true` there and look correct.
- **`on`/`level` are read from the DSP, not from the request.** They are the
  state the WDSP stage actually holds, read across the thread boundary from
  `Hl2RxDsp` or `AnanRxDsp`. `requestedOn`/`requestedLevel` are what the backend
  was asked for. Reporting both is the point: the request is stored synchronously while
  the stage is configured through a queued call, so **a mismatch between the
  pairs is exactly the "the control moves and nothing happens" failure this
  verb exists to catch.** A readback that echoed the request would certify its
  own input.
- Because the seam is asynchronous, the pairs can differ for a few
  milliseconds right after a toggle. A driver asserts on them settling, not on
  the first read — `wait_for` rather than a bare `get`.
- On ANAN, `hasChain` is false until a channel is installed. An asynchronous
  rebuild keeps the outgoing channel, so readback continues to report its
  applied state until the swap. A disconnect retains that channel too: this
  field describes the DSP stage, not whether radio samples are arriving.
  With no chain, `on` is false and `level` is zero, regardless of the request.
- `threshold` is what WDSP got, computed from the **applied** level: the 0..100
  level runs the opposite way from WDSP's trigger (a multiple of the running
  average magnitude, so **smaller is more aggressive**). Level 0 → 100,
  level 50 → 20, level 100 → 4.
- `on`/`level` are **per receiver**, not radio-wide — unlike the notches. HL2
  can report multiple receivers; ANAN currently reports DDC 0 only. ANAN
  retains the requested NB pair across reconnects and radio identity changes,
  and publishes it to the replacement slice so its NB button agrees.
- Errors on a radio that does not declare the capability, rather than returning
  an empty success that a test could pass against.

**Proving the blanker end to end:**

```
slice dsp nb on 80          # drive the control the operator drives
get hostnb                  # DSP agrees: on=true, level=80, threshold≈7.6,
                            #   and requestedOn/requestedLevel match it
get slice active nb         # model agrees too
slice dsp nb off
get hostnb                  # on=false everywhere
```

### `tune`
Set a slice's frequency in MHz — the most fundamental control the
custom-painted `VfoWidget` couldn't expose. RX/config only; despite the name it
does **not** key (cf. `atu tune`, which does). Honors the per-slice VFO lock.

Without a slice id the **active slice** is tuned (the original verb shape).
An optional second argument (bare line) / `id` field (JSON) targets a specific
slice by id, so scripts driving a non-active slice no longer need the racy
`slice select` → `tune` → re-select flap:

```json
→ {"cmd":"tune","value":"7.175"}
← {"ok":true,"tune":7.175,"sliceId":0,"letter":"A"}

→ {"cmd":"tune","value":"14.074","id":"1"}
← {"ok":true,"tune":14.074,"sliceId":1,"letter":"B"}
```

Bare-line form: `tune 14.074 1`.

Refused with `refused: slice A is VFO-locked` when the slice is locked, with
`no slice with id N` when the id names no slice, and with `refused: slice N
belongs to another client` when another client owns it (Multi-Flex). To
recenter the *pan* (band change) rather than move the slice within it, use
[`pan center`](#pan).

**The value is MHz.** Passing Hz is refused rather than converted:

```json
→ {"cmd":"tune","value":"14200000"}
← {"ok":false,"error":"tune takes MHz, not Hz — got 14200000 (did you mean 14.200000?)"}
```

The threshold is 105000 (ten times the top of the band table), so any value a
transverter could plausibly need still passes. It is deliberately not
auto-corrected: `14200000` would have to mean 14.2 MHz here and something else
in every other frequency verb.

Four refusals guard the value, and the wording differs on purpose. The same
four — same thresholds, one shared helper, the verb's own name in the message
— also guard [`targettune`](#targettune) and [`pan center`](#pan):

| input | reply |
|---|---|
| `> 300000` | `tune takes MHz, not Hz — got 14200000 (did you mean 14.200000?)` |
| `> 105000`, `<= 300000` | `tune takes MHz — got 122250, above the 105000 MHz ceiling. If that was Hz, resend as 0.122250; if it is a millimetre-wave frequency in MHz, it is beyond what AetherSDR can tune` |
| `< 0.001` | `tune requires at least 0.001 MHz — got 1e-300` |
| `nan`, `inf`, `-inf`, `0`, negatives, unparseable | `tune requires a positive finite frequency in MHz` |

The second row exists because that window is genuinely ambiguous — an Hz
mistake, or a real millimetre-wave allocation (122.25 / 134 / 241 GHz) entered
correctly in MHz — so the reply offers both readings rather than asserting a
conversion. `nan` and `inf` get their own row because `"nan"` parses as a number
and fails every range comparison, so it would otherwise pass the guard entirely.

**kHz-for-MHz is accepted**, not refused: `tune 14200` is indistinguishable from
a 14.2 GHz transverter request, which is inside the headroom the ceiling exists
to protect. It reaches the radio and, if 14.2 GHz is out of range, becomes the
same silent no-op described below — so a client that might send kHz should
verify with [`get slices`](#get).

Note `ok:true` is an **acknowledgement, not a confirmation** — `tune` echoes the
frequency you asked for. The slice model records a tune optimistically and the
radio's own value arrives asynchronously afterwards, so a request the radio
rejects or clamps still returns `ok:true` with the requested value echoed back.
Read the frequency back with [`get slices`](#get) if you need to know where the
radio actually landed.

### `targettune`
Tune through the same absolute-target policy used by typed frequency entry and
other commanded jumps. Unlike `tune`, this can preselect a different band stack
before applying the final frequency, so it is the bridge path for testing
radio-authoritative band restores. RX/config only and honors VFO lock and SWR
sweep guards.

```json
→ {"cmd":"targettune","value":"146.520"}
← {"ok":true,"targetTune":146.52,"sliceId":0,"letter":"A"}
```

**The value is MHz.** The [four refusals listed under `tune`](#tune) apply here
unchanged — same thresholds, same shared helper, `targettune` in the message:

```json
→ {"cmd":"targettune","value":"14200000"}
← {"ok":false,"error":"targettune takes MHz, not Hz — got 14200000 (did you mean 14.200000?)"}
```

`ok:true` carries the same caveat as `tune`: it is an acknowledgement that the
request was accepted and dispatched, not a confirmation that the radio landed
there. Read the frequency back with [`get slices`](#get) if you need to know.

### `memory`
Recall a radio memory through `MainWindow::activateMemorySpot()`, including its
cross-band preselection and delayed reveal behavior. The optional `panId`
selects the target pan; omit it to use the active/preferred slice. RX/config
only.

```json
→ {"cmd":"memory","action":"activate","value":"12 0x40000000"}
← {"ok":true,"memory":"activate","index":12,"panId":"0x40000000"}
```

Works the same whether the slots live in the radio (Flex) or in the host-side
memory bank (`LocalMemoryBank`, used by HL2/Kiwi/demo and whenever no radio is
connected). On the local bank there is no radio-side `memory apply`, so
`RadioModel::recallLocalMemory()` applies the stored channel to the active slice
through SliceModel's operator-issue setters — the same path the panel controls
use, so the write reaches the radio through the backend seam.

`activate` is currently the only action. Saving, listing, and removing memories
still require driving the GUI (the Memory dialog's Import/Export use NATIVE file
dialogs, which the bridge cannot reach at all) — see the verb suggestions at the
end of this document.

### `slice`
Slice lifecycle, mode, diversity, Center Lock, Slice Link, TX assignment,
antennas, and receive source. All actions are RX/config — none keys the
transmitter. `add`/`remove`/`tx`/`diversity` are async (radio-authoritative);
re-poll `get slices`.

```json
→ {"cmd":"slice","action":"add","value":"14.074"}
← {"ok":true,"slice":"add","freq":14.074,"requested":true,"sliceCount":2}

→ {"cmd":"slice","action":"tx","value":"1"}
← {"ok":true,"slice":"tx","id":1,"requested":true}

→ {"cmd":"slice","action":"mode","value":"DSTR"}
← {"ok":true,"slice":"mode","id":0,"mode":"DSTR","requested":true}
```

| `action` | `value` | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `add` | optional `<mhz>` | request a slice through RadioModel (radio-wide slot capacity is pre-checked; refused at the slice limit, naming any foreign occupant). Omit the value for default placement; an explicit value follows the same parse and tunable-range rule as `tune`, so a malformed, non-finite, non-positive or out-of-band value is an error, never a default-frequency fallback |
| `remove` | `<sliceId>` | remove a slice (refuses the last one) |
| `select` | `<sliceId>` | make a slice the active slice (`slice set <id> active=1`) |
| `tx` | `<sliceId>` | make a slice the TX slice — the external-split transition; radio enforces single-TX |
| `mode` | `<name>` e.g. `DSTR` | set the active slice mode through `SliceModel`; validated against the radio-advertised mode list |
| `filter` | `<lowHz> <highHz>` e.g. `-3000 -150` | set the active slice passband through `SliceModel::setFilterWidth`, the operator-intent setter — so the edges reach `IRadioBackend::setSliceFilter` and not just the model. Necessary because a mode change mirrors the passband *inside* the model without emitting that intent, which can leave a backend that owns its own DSP chain running the pre-mirror passband while `get_state` reports the mirrored one. Assert the passband before measuring anything through the audio path. Returns both the requested edges and the post-normalization `filterLow`/`filterHigh` the model actually holds. Use `-4000 4000` for a carrier-straddling AM passband |
| `filterpreset` | `<FIL1\|FIL2\|FIL3>` | select a stable radio-owned RX filter slot without conflating it with a passband-width edit. Returns the requested slot; re-poll `get slice active filterPreset` and the filter edges for radio-authoritative readback |
| `agc` | `<off\|slow\|med\|fast> [threshold 0..100]` | set the active slice's receive AGC through `SliceModel`'s operator setters, so it emits `agcCommandIssued` and reaches `IRadioBackend::setSliceAgc`. Applies the threshold before the mode so a combined request arrives at the backend as one coherent pair. On a backend that owns its DSP chain (HL2) this maps to the WDSP RXA AGC mode and the AGC ceiling in dB; on Flex it is the firmware's own AGC. Use `off` with a low threshold to get a linear path for measurement |
| `dsp` | `<nr\|nb\|anf\|squelch> <on\|off> [level]` | drive the receive DSP controls an operator drives — noise blanker, noise reduction, auto-notch, and squelch (with an optional 0..100 level). `slice dsp squelch` is the squelch path; there is deliberately no separate squelch verb (#5102) |
| `tone` | `<off\|ctcss_tx> [freq]` | set the FM CTCSS encode mode and tone. The value is applied before the mode, so enabling CTCSS never keys on the previous tone for a round trip. The mode pair is what a FlexRadio slice carries |
| `offset` | `<simplex\|up\|down> [mhz]` | set repeater duplex. The magnitude is unsigned (0..100 MHz — the GUI spinboxes' own bound); the direction carries the sign. Writes all three radio fields — `repeater_offset_dir`, `fm_repeater_offset_freq` **and** the signed `tx_offset_freq` that actually moves the transmitter — then reports `txOffsetFreq` so the applied split can be asserted rather than assumed |
| `diversity` | `<sliceId> <on\|off>` | enable or disable diversity through the slice model; re-poll `get slices` for parent/child state |
| `centerlock` | `<sliceId> <on\|off>` | enable or disable Center Lock for that exact slice through the same per-pan path as the context menu; an explicit id permits testing either diversity member |
| `link` | `<sliceIdA> <sliceIdB> <on\|off>` | engage or dissolve one cross-panadapter Slice Link pair through the same MainWindow handler as the context menu; multiple independent pairs are supported, but each owned non-diversity slice may belong to only one pair — assert each pair via the reciprocal `linkedTo` snapshot fields |
| `txant` / `rxant` | `<port>` e.g. `ANT2` | set the TX/RX antenna of the TX (else active) slice; validated against the slice's antenna list — establish the dummy-load antenna before any TX-safety gate, then read back with `get slice tx txAntenna` |
| `rxsource` (alias `source`) | see below | select the slice's receive source (Flex / virtual-Kiwi) |
| `fixture` | `<sliceId> [A-H]` | disconnected-only test fixture: synthesize an owned slice through the normal slice-status path, optionally with a single radio `index_letter`, so `dumpTree` can assert UI without a radio |
| `clearfixture` | `<sliceId>` | remove a slice created by `fixture`; when the final fixture is removed, restores the pre-fixture disconnected model/max-slice state |

Ordinary `add`/`remove` requests report acceptance, not completion. An accepted
request can still be pending; re-poll `get slices` for authoritative ownership.
Explicit invalid `add` values are refused after the capacity pre-check with
the shared MHz wording (`"slice add requires a positive finite frequency in
MHz"`, or the `tune`-style range message). A RadioModel refusal returns
`"refused: radio did not accept slice creation"` or
`"refused: radio did not accept slice removal"`; this includes unsupported
backend operations and does not imply that a wire command was sent. The latter
replaces the earlier non-Flex `"not supported on this radio (no Flex command
plane)"` response, so scripts matching that text must update. Removal retains
`"refused: cannot remove the last slice"` and `"no slice with id <sliceId>"`
for the local last-slice and unknown-ID checks, respectively.

For a manual SQL band/profile-restore check, compare `get slice`'s
`squelch`/`squelchLevel` with `dumpTree`'s **RX applet → Squelch threshold**
and the VFO SQL control immediately after the transition. A radio-driven
Off → Manual transition must adopt the incoming threshold before refreshing
the controls (#5501). Use distinct thresholds on the two bands and retain
each checkpoint: a later mode change can conceal a stale slider by causing
another status update. In Auto, the slider is the margin, so it is not
expected to equal the radio's computed threshold. Passive command suppression
is covered by the socket-free `rx_applet_squelch_reconciliation_test`; a live
snapshot alone cannot prove that no command was sent.

A full SQL-on report after leaving Auto is adopted as current radio state,
even when its threshold matches an earlier Auto calculation. The report
does not identify whether it is a delayed echo or a restore. A later Off
acknowledgement supersedes it; neither passive report triggers a SQL write.
The socket-free regression pins both operator-driven and radio-driven Off
sequences. It does not establish their occurrence on particular firmware.

### `notch`

Manual notch filters — a Flex TNF, or the WDSP null that stands in for one on a
radio with no DSP of its own (HL2). All actions are RX/config; none keys the
transmitter.

Driven through `TnfModel`'s operator setters, so the intent reaches
`IRadioBackend`'s notch verbs and not just the model. Notch **ids are assigned
by the backend** — a Flex mints them in the radio, a host-DSP backend in this
process — so `add` cannot tell you the id it created. Re-poll `notch list`.

```json
→ {"cmd":"notch","action":"list"}
← {"ok":true,"notch":"list","enabled":true,"maxNotchFilters":1024,
   "minWidthHz":50,"hasDepth":false,"notches":[]}

→ {"cmd":"notch","action":"add","value":"7.041"}
← {"ok":true,"notch":"add","freqMhz":7.041,"notches":[{"id":1,"freqMhz":7.041,"widthHz":100,…}]}

→ {"cmd":"notch","action":"set","value":"1 width=200"}
← {"ok":true,"notch":"set","id":1,"notches":[{"id":1,"freqMhz":7.041,"widthHz":200,…}]}
```

| `action` | `value` | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | — | every notch the model holds, plus the radio's declared `maxNotchFilters`, `minWidthHz` and `hasDepth`. **Report the capabilities alongside the list deliberately:** an empty list on a radio that cannot notch is indistinguishable from a notch that was placed and silently dropped, and only `maxNotchFilters` tells the two apart |
| `add` | `<freqMhz> [widthHz]` | place a notch at an absolute RF frequency. The width comes from the model's create default, and a Flex assigns its own regardless — so a width passed here is validated and echoed as `requestedWidthHz`, NOT honoured. The width in `notches` is the one the notch actually got; use `set … width=` to resize. Async on Flex (the radio assigns the id) — re-poll `list` |
| `set` | `<id> [freq=<mhz>] [width=<hz>] [depth=<1-3>]` | move, resize, or re-depth an existing notch. Each key is applied as its own delta, in the order given — the seam accepts a combined centre+width delta but no caller builds one yet, so a two-key call costs two filter-mask rebuilds. `depth` is Flex-only — a WDSP notch is a full null, and `hasDepth` in `list` says which you have |
| `remove` | `<id>` | remove a notch. Removal is optimistic in the model, so `list` reflects it immediately |
| `enable` | `0` / `1` | the global notch bypass (`tnf_enabled` on a Flex). Individual notches keep their own state underneath |

**Proving a notch actually works, not just that it was accepted.** `list` shows
model state, which is populated optimistically — it will happily report a notch
that never reached the DSP. To prove the null exists, park a notch on a real
carrier and measure through the audio path: `capture_audio` with the notch
disabled, then enabled, and compare. On a host-DSP backend also check the
**width** you read back against `minWidthHz`: WDSP widens a too-narrow notch
without reporting it, so a notch can be real, audible, and four times wider than
the one drawn on screen.

### `gps`

Inject a disconnected-only GPS report through `RadioModel::applyGpsChanges`,
the same typed-delta path used by live `FlexBackend` status. This is safe for
deterministic dashboard and model testing: it is refused while connected and
never sends a radio command.

```json
→ {"cmd":"gps","action":"fixture","value":"6000"}
← {"ok":true,"gps":"fixture","profile":"6000","snapshot":{"status":"Locked","latitude":"N 34 13.464",…}}

→ {"cmd":"gps","action":"fixture","value":"8000"}
← {"ok":true,"gps":"fixture","profile":"8000","snapshot":{"status":"Locked","latitude":"34.224400000","ntpServerAddress":"192.0.2.80",…}}

→ {"cmd":"gps","action":"clearfixture"}
← {"ok":true,"gps":"clearfixture"}
```

Both profiles use the public Mount Wilson Observatory location so screenshots
are safe to share. The `6000` profile exercises the hemisphere/degrees/decimal-
minutes form seen from a FLEX-6700 GPSDO. The `8000` profile exercises decimal
degrees and the `track` (course-over-ground) field captured from FLEX-8600
firmware 4.2.18, plus the reserved TEST-NET-1 address `192.0.2.80` for testing
the 8000-series NTP tip. Use `get gps` or `dumpTree` after injecting to assert
model or widget state.

#### `slice rxsource`
Selects the receive source for a slice through the same virtual-Kiwi path as
the GUI RX antenna menus. The source selector is not a static list: it resolves
against the operator's saved Kiwi receiver profiles by configured name, display
name, profile id, virtual antenna token, or endpoint. Use `flex`, `none`, or
`clear` to return the slice to Flex audio.

```json
→ {"cmd":"slice","action":"rxsource","value":"7 K4JK"}
← {"ok":true,"slice":"rxsource","id":7,"source":"kiwi",
   "profileName":"K4JK","requested":true}

→ {"cmd":"slice","action":"rxsource","value":"7 flex"}
← {"ok":true,"slice":"rxsource","id":7,"source":"flex","requested":true}
```

### `close`
Close the target's **top-level window**. Resolves `target` like `grab`, then
closes `target->window()` — so a child control closes its dialog. This reaches
the custom frameless title-bar close (a clickable `QLabel`, accessibleName
*Close window*) that `invoke … click` can't target, and works for any window.

```json
→ {"cmd":"close","target":"Theme actions"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"Theme actions","class":"ThemeEditorDialog",
   "title":"Theme Editor — Default Dark","deferred":true}
```

`deferred:true`: the close runs on the next main-loop turn (a `closeEvent` may
pop a confirm dialog), so re-read `dumpTree` to confirm the window is gone.

### `drag` (alias `mouse`)
Synthesize a `press → move → release` gesture so a resize grip or slider handle
is provable end-to-end, not just via seed + read-back.

```json
→ {"cmd":"drag","target":"QSizeGrip","value":"140 90"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"QSizeGrip","class":"QSizeGrip","dx":140,"dy":90}
```

`value` is `"<dx> <dy>"` in pixels from the widget centre. Global coordinates are
computed once from the press point (a `QSizeGrip` moves as the window resizes, so
re-mapping mid-drag would overshoot) — a `140 90` grip drag grows the window by
exactly 140×90.

### `dragAt`
Synthesize a drag from an exact target-local point. Optional modifiers are a
comma- or plus-separated combination of `control`, `meta`, `shift`, and `alt`
(`cmd`/`command` and `option` are accepted aliases). This reaches custom-widget
gestures whose behavior depends on both position and a held modifier. As with
`clickAt`, the drag is refused when the target or an ancestor is marked as a
TX-keying control unless transmit automation is explicitly enabled.

```json
→ {"cmd":"dragAt","target":"SpectrumWidget","value":"1564 100 0 300 meta"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"SpectrumWidget","class":"SpectrumWidget",
   "x":1564,"y":100,"dx":0,"dy":300,"modifiers":268435456}
```

`drag` remains the backward-compatible one-shot form. It now enforces the same
disabled-control, TX-keying, and `AETHER_AUTOMATION_TX_MAX_POWER` pointer rails
as `clickAt`; it cannot be used to bypass those guards.

### `gesture`
Keep a real left-button gesture open across multiple main-loop requests. This is
the phaseful counterpart to atomic [`drag`](#drag-alias-mouse), intended for
testing behavior such as a delayed model/radio update arriving while
`QAbstractSlider::isSliderDown()` is genuinely true.

```json
→ {"cmd":"gesture","action":"begin","target":"RF power"}
← {"ok":true,"active":true,"sliderDown":true,"value":50,"leaseMs":60000}

→ {"cmd":"gesture","action":"move","value":"0 -30"}
← {"ok":true,"active":true,"sliderDown":true,"dx":0,"dy":-30}

→ {"cmd":"gesture","action":"end"}
← {"ok":true,"active":false,"target":"RF power","dx":0,"dy":-30}
```

Phases:

- `begin <target> [x y]` presses at the widget center, or at optional local
  coordinates. Only one phaseful gesture may exist in the app at once.
- `move <dx> <dy>` sends a move at fixed-base offsets from the original press.
- `status` is read-only and reports `active`, ownership, offsets, and
  `sliderDown`/`value` for a slider.
- `end [dx dy]` optionally moves to a final offset, then releases.
- `cancel` releases at the current offset.

The owning bridge connection must remain open between phases. The typed MCP
`gesture` tool does this automatically while ordinary tools keep using separate
connections, which is what lets an independent `invoke`, `dump_tree`, or delayed
app event interleave. Raw clients must reuse one socket themselves.

Safety is fail-closed: auth and observe-only checks apply to every phase; begin
uses the same disabled-control, TX-keying, and power-ceiling rails as pointer
clicks. End, cancel, malformed continuation, target destruction, client
disconnect, bridge stop, or 60 seconds without a move all synthesize the release
and clear ownership.

### `hover`
Synthesize a pointer **hover** over a widget (no button pressed, unlike `drag`)
so hover-driven UI is provable end-to-end. The bare form fires a `QEnterEvent`
plus a no-button `QMouseMove` at the widget centre; the `leave` form fires a
`QEvent::Leave` so a driver can watch a fade-after-exit timer.

```json
→ {"cmd":"hover","target":"Forward power gauge"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"Forward power gauge","class":"QWidget","action":"enter","x":1572,"y":993}
→ {"cmd":"hover","target":"Forward power gauge","action":"leave"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"Forward power gauge","class":"QWidget","action":"leave", ...}
```

Used to prove the TX meter mouse-over value readout: the SWR / forward-power /
ALC / mic-level / compression `HGauge`s pop a `DragValuePopup` badge (the same
one the sliders flash) showing the live numeric value while hovered, which fades
`DragValuePopup::kDefaultLingerMs` (450 ms) after the pointer leaves.

**At most one badge is visible app-wide.** Entering a second gauge closes the
first one's badge, so a traverse across the stacked TX meters can never leave
two overlapping. A driver asserting the hand-off should `hover` the second
gauge and check the first's badge within that 450 ms window — a `leave` on the
first is *not* required, and waiting out the linger between hovers proves
nothing.

Grab the badge with `grab DragValuePopup`. Widget resolution ranks visible and
enabled matches ahead of hidden ones, and the hand-off above guarantees at most
one badge is visible, so the name resolves to whichever gauge's badge is
actually on screen — no per-instance disambiguation needed.

`grab` on the *gauge* does not help: `grab` ends in `QWidget::grab()`, which
renders only that widget's own subtree, and the badge is a separate top-level
`Qt::ToolTip` window anchored 16 px *above* the gauge rect — so the capture
comes back as a bare bar. To assert *which* badge is up and where, read the
`DragValuePopup` nodes out of `dumpTree` (each carries `visible` plus
geometry). The badge is itself a window, so per the `dumpTree` section above it
appears exactly **once, as a root**, never nested under the gauge that owns it.
Walk `roots` to find it; do not look for it under `TxApplet`.

An injected hover holds the badge until an explicit `hover <target> leave`:
the recovery watchdog that bounds a dropped physical leave is gated on the real
cursor position, and `hover` does not move the cursor, so a driver's badge is
never torn down underneath it by a live meter frame.

### `tooltip`
Force-show a widget's native Qt tooltip, using the widget's current
`toolTip()` text unless an override string is supplied. This is for screenshots
and assertions where injected hover should prove the target state but the
platform does not run Qt's built-in tooltip timer under automation.

```text
→ {"cmd":"tooltip","target":"E"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"E","class":"QToolButton",
   "text":"Slice E (global slot 5)","grabHint":"QTipLabel", ...}
→ tooltip E Screenshot override text
← {"ok":true,"target":"E","text":"Screenshot override text", ...}
→ {"cmd":"grab","target":"QTipLabel","path":"/tmp/slice-tooltip.png"}
← {"ok":true,"class":"QTipLabel","path":"/tmp/slice-tooltip.png", ...}
```

Use `{"cmd":"tooltip","target":"E","action":"hide"}` to dismiss it.

Item views keep their tips on the items, not the widget, so the form above
answers `target has no tooltip` when the table has no widget-level tip. The
cell form sends the same help event at one cell's rectangle, to the view's viewport, which is what a
real hover does:

```text
→ tooltip networkDiagnosticsTciClients cell 0 0
← {"ok":true,"target":"networkDiagnosticsTciClients","class":"QTableWidget",
   "row":0,"col":0,"text":"Your own label for this client (saved locally, keyed by IP)",
   "accepted":true,"grabHint":"QTipLabel", ...}
→ {"cmd":"tooltip","target":"networkDiagnosticsTciClients","action":"cell","value":"0 0"}
```

The row is scrolled into view first; the help event targets the visible part
of the cell, including when the cell is wider than the viewport. A cell whose
`Qt::ToolTipRole` is empty
answers `cell has no tooltip`; a row or column the view hides (a search
filter, `setColumnHidden`) answers
`cell is not visible (hidden or outside viewport)`; a target that is not a
`QAbstractItemView` answers `target is not an item view`; the text form with anything other than exactly `<row> <col>`
after `cell` answers `tooltip cell takes exactly <row> <col>` (an override
that literally starts with "cell" goes through the JSON `value` field, as
for `hide`). This reserves `cell` as a keyword in the text form; existing
widget tooltip overrides otherwise keep their behavior. A model reset or view
replacement during scrolling answers `cell changed while scrolling`.
Rows address the first level below the view's current root, as with `cell`.

### `cell`
Read one item-view cell as data — no hover, no timing. Works for any
`QAbstractItemView` (`QTableWidget`, `QTreeWidget`, `QListWidget`, model
views) because it reads the model's roles rather than `QTableWidget::item()`.
`toolTip` is the item's `Qt::ToolTipRole`, the same text a hover would raise,
so a per-cell tip is assertable in one round trip. `cell` is a pure read and
is allowed in observe-only mode; the `tooltip ... cell` form is not.

```text
→ cell networkDiagnosticsTciClients 0 1
← {"ok":true,"target":"networkDiagnosticsTciClients","class":"QTableWidget",
   "row":0,"col":1,"text":"127.0.0.1:56564","toolTip":"","accessibleText":"",
   "selected":false,"rows":1,"cols":7}
→ {"cmd":"cell","target":"networkDiagnosticsTciClients","value":"0 1"}
```

`rows`/`cols` report the model's extent under the view's current root, and
indices address that same level. With the default root these are top-level
rows; descendants below the displayed root's first level are not addressable.
Sorted/proxy views use their displayed model's row order.

Both cell forms share these errors: `view has no model`,
`cell needs integer row and column indices` (missing, extra, noninteger, or
overflowing operands), `row N out of range [0,R)`,
`column N out of range [0,C)`, `cell has no valid model index`, and
`target is not an item view`. A missing target answers
`widget or window not found`; the bare `cell` command without a target
answers `cell requires a target item view`. Hidden views can be read with
`cell`, but `tooltip` refuses them as `refused: '<target>' is not visible`.

### `scrollTo` (alias `ensureVisible`)
Scroll the target's nearest `QScrollArea` ancestor so the widget sits in the
viewport. Widgets parked below the fold of a scroll area receive **no paint
events at all** until scrolled into view (macOS clips paint delivery to the
exposed area), so a driver must bring them on screen before measuring,
hovering, or grabbing live content — e.g. the Aetherial strip's waveform
panel at the bottom of the strip's scroll column.

```json
→ {"cmd":"scrollTo","target":"stripWaveformScope"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"stripWaveformScope","class":"WaveformWidget",
   "scrollArea":"QScrollArea","vScroll":812,"hScroll":0,"inViewport":true}
```

`vScroll`/`hScroll` echo the resulting scrollbar positions and `inViewport`
confirms the widget's rect now intersects the viewport — assert on it before
trusting a follow-up measurement.

Related targeting change: when several widgets match a class, accessibleName,
or objectName target, resolution now prefers a **visible** match (every scroll
area owns hidden `QScrollBar`s next to the visible one; the strip owns a
hidden TX scope next to the visible RX one). Hidden widgets remain addressable
when they're the only match, so hidden-container grabs keep working.

### `showMenu` (alias `openMenu`)
Pop a `QToolButton`/`QPushButton` drop-down menu. The show is posted onto the GUI
event loop with the owning window raised + activated first — showing the native
popup from inside the socket-read callback, or while the app is backgrounded,
re-enters Cocoa and segfaults. Returns `deferred:true`; `dumpTree` to read the
opened menu. A button with no menu returns an error.

```json
→ {"cmd":"showMenu","target":"Theme actions"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"Theme actions","class":"QPushButton","deferred":true}
```

### `contextMenu`
Trigger a widget's **custom right-click context menu** — the kind built on demand
in a `customContextMenuRequested` handler (`Qt::CustomContextMenu`) or an
overridden `contextMenuEvent` (`Qt::DefaultContextMenu`), which `showMenu` can't
reach because it only follows `QToolButton`/`QPushButton::menu()`. We synthesize a
`QContextMenuEvent` at the widget center (or an optional `x y` local offset) and
route it through the widget's `event()`, so Qt dispatches by the widget's context
policy automatically — `CustomContextMenu` emits `customContextMenuRequested`,
`DefaultContextMenu` calls the overridden `contextMenuEvent`. Like `showMenu`, the
trigger is posted onto the GUI event loop with the owning window raised first (the
handler pops a `QMenu` that runs its own event loop). Returns `deferred:true`;
`dumpTree` to read the opened menu, then `invoke` an item by text/path.

```json
→ {"cmd":"contextMenu","target":"SMeterWidget"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"SMeterWidget","class":"SMeterWidget","x":40,"y":12,"deferred":true}

→ {"cmd":"contextMenu","target":"SMeterWidget","value":"40 12"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"SMeterWidget","class":"SMeterWidget","x":40,"y":12,"deferred":true}
```

### `rightClick`
Trigger a widget path that handles right-clicks directly in `mousePressEvent`,
rather than through Qt's `contextMenuEvent`/`customContextMenuRequested` policy.
The panadapter's `SpectrumWidget` menu is the main use case: it is position
sensitive and built from a real right-button press, so [`contextMenu`](#contextmenu)
cannot reach it.

```json
→ {"cmd":"rightClick","target":"Panadapter spectrum display"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"Panadapter spectrum display","class":"SpectrumWidget",
   "x":939,"y":735,"deferred":true}

→ {"cmd":"rightClick","target":"Panadapter spectrum display","value":"940 730"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"Panadapter spectrum display","class":"SpectrumWidget",
   "x":940,"y":730,"deferred":true}
```

The verb posts a right-button `MouseButtonPress` onto the GUI event loop with the
owning window raised, then returns immediately. Follow with `dumpTree` to inspect
the visible `QMenu`, and `invoke <menu item text> trigger` to choose an action.

Section-title rows (a disabled `QWidgetAction` + `QLabel`, the app's idiom for
menu headers since `QMenu::addSection` text doesn't render under the app styling)
serialize with `"type":"header"` and the label's text, so titles are assertable
instead of blank rows.

### `text`
Full plain text of one `QTextEdit` / `QPlainTextEdit` view (alias `getText`). Read-only; refused in
observe-only mode like every non-allow-listed verb is — except that `text` *is* allow-listed, since it
sets nothing and keys nothing.

```json
→ {"cmd":"text","target":"cwDecodeText"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"cwDecodeText","class":"QPlainTextEdit",
   "length":5102,"lines":48,"text":"CQ CQ DE ..."}
```

- `dump_tree` carries only a 2048-character prefix of these views (see the `value` table above; the
  node also carries `valueTruncated: true` when cut); this verb returns the whole document, so a
  transcript assertion is not truncated. The response is unbounded — a long console goes into one
  JSON line; whether it should take a newest-`n`/`path` form like `log tail` / `grab` is an open
  design question.
- `lines` counts lines as the pane shows them: a trailing newline ends the last line rather than
  starting another.
- `length` is UTF-16 code units (`QString::size()`), not Unicode code points: a driver comparing it
  to Python's `len(resp["text"])` will disagree on any document containing astral characters
  (emoji in a chat or cluster pane is the realistic case).
- A non-text target answers `not a text view: <target> (<class>)`.
- The view is read through its `plainText` property (Qt's `QTextEdit`/`QPlainTextEdit` both export it),
  so `QTextBrowser` and read-only views are covered; `QLineEdit` has no such property and keeps its
  echo-mode `<hidden>` guard.

### `hitTest`
Read-only Qt hit-test probe for overlay/input-mask regressions. The point is
target-local; omit `x y` to test the target center. `childAt` is the target's
child owner at that local point, while `widgetAt` is Qt's global topmost widget
owner at the same screen point.

```json
→ {"cmd":"hitTest","target":"SpectrumWidget","value":"80 80"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"SpectrumWidget","x":80,"y":80,
   "childAt":{"class":"VfoWidget",...},
   "widgetAt":{"class":"VfoWidget",...}}
```

### `clickAt`
Synthesize a real left-click (`press`→`release`) at a **point** rather than at a
named widget. This is the escape hatch for when `invoke`/name matching can't reach
the control you want — most commonly because several widgets share the same
`accessibleName` (every side-panel tile's close button is `containerClose`, its
float toggle `containerFloatToggle`, etc.), so `invoke` can only ever hit the
**first** match. `dumpTree` reports widget `geometry` in **global (screen)**
coordinates, so clicking the centre of a tile's dumpTree rect clicks exactly that
tile's control.

Two forms:
- **`clickAt <x> <y>`** — `x y` are **global** screen coordinates. The bridge
  clicks whatever `QApplication::widgetAt(x, y)` resolves (the topmost widget at
  that point).
- **`clickAt <target> <x> <y>`** — `x y` are **local** to `<target>` (like
  `hitTest`); the point must lie inside the target's rect, and the click is
  routed to the deepest `childAt` that point.

The click is **TX-guarded** like `invoke`, but stricter: the guard walks the
**whole ancestor chain** of the widget under the point (Qt propagates an
unaccepted press to parents, so a click on a passive child of a keying control
must be refused too) and is refused unless `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1` — a
coordinate click is never a hole around the keying gate. Clicks on the RF/Tune
power sliders are refused while `AETHER_AUTOMATION_TX_MAX_POWER` is armed (a
groove click can't be clamped — use `invoke … setValue`, which is). A disabled
widget under the point is refused (`"disabled":true`), same as `invoke`.

Delivery is deferred one main-loop turn (`"deferred":true`), so any popup/dialog
it raises runs on a clean stack; follow with `dumpTree`/`grab` to read the
result. Because the reply is sent **before** delivery, anything already queued
(a relayout, a pan re-center) can change what that pixel means by the time the
press lands — re-`dumpTree` right before `clickAt` and don't interleave other
mutating verbs in between.

In the reply, `localX`/`localY` are local to the widget the click was **routed
to** (`clicked`) — the deepest child — not to the named `<target>`, so for the
target-local form they generally differ from the `x y` you sent.

```json
→ {"cmd":"clickAt","x":1420,"y":210}          // global point (or "value":"1420 210")
← {"ok":true,"clicked":{"class":"QPushButton","accessibleName":"containerClose",…},
   "globalX":1420,"globalY":210,"localX":7,"localY":6,"deferred":true}

→ {"cmd":"clickAt","target":"AppletPanel","value":"12 34"}   // point local to a widget
← {"ok":true,"clicked":{"class":"…"},"globalX":1318,"globalY":97,
   "localX":5,"localY":3,"deferred":true}     // local to `clicked`, not to AppletPanel
```

The JSON `x`/`y` fields must both be present and JSON-numeric; a missing or
string-typed coordinate is rejected rather than coerced to 0 (which would click
the screen edge).

Recipe — close a **specific** side-panel tile (not just the first `containerClose`):
read the target tile's `containerClose` rect from `dumpTree`, compute its centre in
global coordinates, and `clickAt` that point.

### `doubleClick`
Double-click a **named** widget. Two `clickAt` calls are not a substitute: Qt does
not promote a pair of synthetic press/release sequences into a double-click, so a
widget that overrides `mouseDoubleClickEvent` — the VFO DIG offset inline editor,
the TX filter cut readouts — never hears one. The delivered sequence is Qt's own
(`Press` → `Release` → `DblClick` → `Release`; the window system sends the
`DblClick` *instead of* the second press).

`x y` are **local** to `<target>` and optional — omitted, the widget's rect centre
is used, which is the point a person would hit. Guards, TX refusals and deferred
delivery are inherited wholesale from [`clickAt`](#clickat), which does the actual
delivery.

```json
→ {"cmd":"doubleClick","target":"txFilterHighCut"}          // centre of the widget
← {"ok":true,"clicked":{"class":"ScrollableLabel",…},"deferred":true}

→ {"cmd":"doubleClick","target":"txFilterHighCut","x":10,"y":12}   // target-local point
← {"ok":true,"clicked":{"class":"ScrollableLabel",…},"deferred":true}
```

Aliases: `doubleclick`, `dblClick`.

### `doubleClickAt`
The double-click twin of [`clickAt`](#clickat), with the same two forms and the
same overload rule (a numeric first token means the global form):

- **`doubleClickAt <x> <y>`** — `x y` are **global** screen coordinates.
- **`doubleClickAt <target> <x> <y>`** — `x y` are **local** to `<target>`.

```json
→ {"cmd":"doubleClickAt","x":1420,"y":210}                        // global point
→ {"cmd":"doubleClickAt","target":"AppletPanel","x":12,"y":34}    // target-local point
→ {"cmd":"doubleClickAt","target":"AppletPanel","value":"12 34"}  // equivalent
```

As with `clickAt`, the JSON `x`/`y` fields must both be present and JSON-numeric;
a missing or string-typed coordinate is rejected rather than coerced to 0. An
explicit `value` wins over `x`/`y`. The same normalization applies to every alias
spelling (`doubleclickat`, `dblClickAt`) and to `doubleClick`'s optional
coordinates, so `bridge_command` reaches all three request forms identically.

Aliases: `doubleclickat`, `dblClickAt`.

### `menu`
Enumerate or pop a **menu-bar** menu. On macOS the native menu bar reparents its
menus to top-level `QMenu`s, so `dumpTree` finds them but `menuBar()->actions()`
is empty — this verb walks the real menu set either way.

```json
→ {"cmd":"menu","action":"list"}
← {"ok":true,"menus":[{"title":"View","actions":[
     {"text":"Default Dark","checkable":true,"checked":true,"enabled":true}, …]}, …]}

→ {"cmd":"menu","action":"open","value":"Settings"}
← {"ok":true,"menu":"open","title":"Settings"}
```

`menu open <name>` pops the menu (non-blocking `popup()`, so it can't deadlock the
socket handler); follow with `dumpTree` to read it and `invoke <label> trigger` to
choose an item. To drive a menu item whose menu is **closed**, you don't even need
`menu open` — `invoke "<label>" trigger` resolves a menu-bar `QAction` anywhere,
opening dialogs (AetherControl…, Network…, Radio Setup…) headlessly.

### `resize`
Resize a top-level window so the panadapter `x_pixels` (== `SpectrumWidget` width)
reaches a realistic value for headless render-size fidelity. Without a `target`,
the main window is resized. `full`/`default` → 1920×1080.

```json
→ {"cmd":"resize","value":"1600 900"}
← {"ok":true,"requested":{"w":1600,"h":900},"actual":{"w":1600,"h":900},"spectrumWidth":1340}
```

Returns `spectrumWidth` (the panadapter width that becomes `x_pixels` after the
~300 ms `dimensionsChanged` debounce re-pushes it to the radio). It resizes the
**window**, not `x_pixels` directly, so the local FFT decoder and the radio stay
in sync.

### `window`
Drive a top-level window's state. `resize` only ever sets explicit geometry, so an
un-maximize was previously unprovable; `window restore` does it, and `dumpTree`
carries `windowState` (`normal`/`maximized`/`minimized`/`fullscreen`) on every
window node so the result is assertable (#3918). Without a `target`, the main
window is used.

```json
→ {"cmd":"window","action":"maximize"}
← {"ok":true,"action":"maximize","windowState":"maximized","geometry":{"w":1400,"h":800}}
```

| `action` | aliases | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `maximize` | `max` | `showMaximized()` |
| `restore` | `normal`, `unmaximize` | `showNormal()` (un-maximize / un-fullscreen) |
| `minimize` | `min` | `showMinimized()` |
| `fullscreen` | `full` | `showFullScreen()` |

State changes are synchronous (no nested event loop), so the reply's
`windowState` is authoritative. `resize` and `window` share window-target
resolution (`topLevelWindowForTarget`): a child `target` resolves to its
`window()`.

### `shortcut`
Fire a registered `ShortcutManager` action by id — the **exact** path a MIDI
controller mapping takes (`fireShortcut` → `action(id)->handler()` in
`MainWindow_Controllers.cpp`). Many actions carry no default key sequence **and**
no menu entry — Band Zoom, Segment Zoom, and every MIDI-only trigger — so they're
otherwise unreachable by `invoke` (no widget), a key event (no `QKeySequence`), or
`menu` (no menu item). This verb drives them directly. The id is the shortcut's
registration id (as in the Configure Shortcuts list / MIDI mapping short id), e.g.
`band_zoom`, `segment_zoom`, `split_toggle`, `filter_widen`.

```json
→ {"cmd":"shortcut","target":"band_zoom"}
← {"ok":true,"shortcut":"band_zoom","fired":true}
```

(JSON form: the id rides the `target` field; a `target` present alongside other
fields wins.) The handler runs synchronously on the GUI thread. An unknown id
replies `{"ok":false,"error":"unknown shortcut action id: …"}`.

**`fired:true` means the handler ran, not that anything happened.** Handlers
validate their own preconditions exactly like a physical MIDI press — no radio
connection, no active slice, or no resolvable pan is a silent no-op. Assert
effects through `get`/`dumpTree` (e.g. `get pans` for the zoom actions), not
from the reply.

**Momentary key actions can't be fired by id.** `ptt_hold` and the CW
straight-key/paddle ids appear in the Configure Shortcuts list but register
null handlers on purpose — they're driven by the app-level event filter, which
needs key **release** edges. The bridge replies with a distinct
`event-filter-driven` error for these, not `unknown id`.

**TX-safety:** actions registered as transmit-keying (`keysTx` at their
`registerAction` site — `mox_toggle`, `tune_toggle`, `two_tone_tune`,
`atu_start`, `ptt_hold`, and the CW key ids) are refused unless
`AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1`, mirroring the [`invoke`](#invoke) /
[`key`](#key) TX guard. The gate reads the registration flag — one source of
truth, no bridge-side id list to drift. RX-only actions (the zoom shortcuts
included) need no flag.

### `midi`
Inject one MIDI Control Change value through the same learned VFO Tune Knob
relative decoder used by physical controllers. This focused automation surface
does not create or persist a binding and is RX-only.

```json
→ {"cmd":"midi","action":"cc","value":"65"}
← {"ok":true,"midi":"cc","value":65,"paramId":"rx.tuneKnob","accepted":true}
```

Bare form: `midi cc 65`. Use `get slice active` before and after the injection
to assert that center-64 values 65 and 63 move exactly one configured tuning
step in opposite directions. The controller manager coalesces events for 20 ms,
so callers should wait briefly before reading the resulting slice frequency.

### `pan`
Panadapter lifecycle — create or tear down a pan regardless of how it was opened.

```json
→ {"cmd":"pan","action":"add"}
← {"ok":true,"pan":"add","requested":true,"panCountBefore":1}

→ {"cmd":"pan","action":"close","value":"1"}
← {"ok":true,"pan":"close","requested":true,
   "closed":[{"panId":"0x40000001","waterfallId":"0x42000001","resolved":true}]}
```

| `action` | `value` | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `create` (alias `add`) | — | create a new panadapter (panafall). The only UI path is an unaddressable label. |
| `center` | `<mhz>` | recenter the active pan — the band-change lever (a plain `tune` only moves the slice and clamps to the pan's RF range, #292). **MHz, not Hz**: the [four refusals listed under `tune`](#tune) apply here too, with `pan center` in the message. It matters more on this verb — `setPanCenter()` clamps only the low edge, so an unguarded out-of-range centre is stored and advertised over TCI (`dds:`) even though the radio rejects it. |
| `close` (alias `remove`) | `<panId>` (`0x…`) / `<index>` (panIndex) / `active` / `all` | close pan(s). Sends `display pan remove` **and** `display panafall remove`, so a panafall-created pan closes without the slice-removal workaround. A single target won't close the last pan; `all` will. |

All are async (the radio echoes the change) — re-poll `get pans`. Every `pan`
action is RX/config only; none keys the transmitter.

Floating and docking use the production pan title-bar control rather than a
radio lifecycle command. Target its stable object name through the pan scope;
the same toggle works in both states:

```json
→ {"cmd":"invoke","target":"pan 1/panFloatToggle","action":"click"}
← {"ok":true,"target":"pan 1/panFloatToggle","action":"click"}
```

Re-poll `layout get` and assert `floatingCount` / `dockedCount` after each
transition. The control's accessible name also changes between
`Pop out panadapter` and `Dock panadapter` for semantic snapshots.

### `layout`
Drive the panadapter **splitter layout** directly, decoupled from how many
panadapters the radio has granted.

```json
→ {"cmd":"layout","action":"rearrange","value":"2v"}
← {"ok":true,"layout":"rearrange","requested":"2v","applied":true,
   "fellBack":false,"effectiveLayout":"2v","settlesNextTurn":true,
   "panCount":2,"dockedCount":2,"floatingCount":0,"savedLayout":"1"}

→ {"cmd":"layout","action":"get"}
← {"ok":true,"layout":"get","requested":"","applied":false,
   "panCount":1,"dockedCount":1,"floatingCount":0,"savedLayout":"1"}
```

| `action` | `value` | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `rearrange` | layout id (`1`/`2v`/`2h`/`2h1`/`12h`/`3v`/`2x2`/`4v`/`3h2`/`2x3`/`4h3`/`2x4`) | rebuild the splitter for that id via the production `PanadapterStack::rearrangeLayout`, exercising the full teardown/reparent/GPU-surface path on whatever pans exist. |
| `get` | — | report the saved `PanadapterLayout` + live pan/docked/floating counts without changing anything. |

Why it exists: on a shared radio, MultiFlex caps how many panadapters a client
can open, so the add-2nd-pan resize path (the #4091 crash) can be unreachable
from the bridge. `layout rearrange` forces the splitter machinery to run
regardless. It is a **transient exerciser** — it does *not* persist
`PanadapterLayout`. RX/config only; never keys TX.

Honesty of the reply: an **unknown id is rejected** (`ok:false`) rather than
silently building the trivial fallback; an id needing **more applets than
exist** runs the production vertical-stack fallback and reports
`fellBack:true` + `effectiveLayout:"vstack"` — a test that meant to exercise a
*nested* layout (the #4091 reparent path) must assert `fellBack:false`, or the
green result proves nothing. Geometry **settles on the next event-loop turn**
(`settlesNextTurn:true` — ex-floating pans re-show and sizes equalize
deferred), so don't pipeline `get rhi`/`grab` in the same write; re-poll after.

### `scale`
Report — and optionally persist — the UI scale factor, so scale-dependent
rendering bugs (fractional `QT_SCALE_FACTOR`, e.g. #4091) are reproducible and
assertable.

```json
→ {"cmd":"scale"}
← {"ok":true,"scale":true,"qtScaleFactorEnv":"0.85",
   "uiScalePercentSaved":85,"primaryScreenDpr":2.0}

→ {"cmd":"scale","value":"85"}
← {"ok":true,"scale":true,"qtScaleFactorEnv":null,"uiScalePercentSaved":100,
   "primaryScreenDpr":2.0,"uiScalePercentSet":85,"appliesOnNextLaunch":true}
```

Bare `scale` reports only. `scale <pct>` (one of `75|85|100|110|125|150|175|200`,
matching the **View → UI Scale** menu) persists `UiScalePercent`. Because
`QT_SCALE_FACTOR` must be set before `QApplication` (see `main.cpp`), a scale
change **only applies on the next launch** — this verb never mutates the running
process. To actually run under a fractional scale in one shot, launch with the
env directly: `QT_SCALE_FACTOR=0.85 AETHER_AUTOMATION=1 …`. Pair with `get rhi`
to assert the resulting swapchain dimensions. Never keys TX.

Note: the running session's **View → UI Scale menu checkmark is built once at
startup and will not reflect a bridge write** — the persisted value is applied
(and the menu re-seeded) on the next launch.

### `panmessage`
Manual test hook for panadapter overlay popup messages. This is UI-only: it
does not send radio commands and never keys the transmitter.

```json
→ {"cmd":"panmessage","action":"add","target":"0","id":"kiwi",
   "title":"Waiting for KiwiSDR receiver slot",
   "detail":"Receiver channels are full; AetherSDR will reconnect automatically.",
   "timeoutMs":0}
← {"ok":true,"panmessage":"add","target":"0","id":"kiwi","accepted":true,
   "messages":[{"id":"kiwi","title":"Waiting for KiwiSDR receiver slot",...}]}

→ {"cmd":"panmessage","action":"add","target":"0","id":"tx","timeoutMs":2500,
   "tone":"warning",
   "title":"Transmit disabled",
   "detail":"Transmit is disabled because this panadapter is displaying a KiwiSDR receiver."}
← {"ok":true,"panmessage":"add","target":"0","id":"tx","accepted":true,...}

→ {"cmd":"panmessage","action":"list","target":"0"}
← {"ok":true,"panmessage":"list",
   "messages":[{"id":"tx","remainingMs":1840,"countdown":"2s","tone":"warning",...}]}

→ {"cmd":"panmessage","action":"remove","target":"0","id":"kiwi"}
← {"ok":true,"panmessage":"remove","removed":true,...}
```

Bare-line forms are accepted for quick screenshot setup. For `add`, an optional
`tone=info|warning` may follow `<timeoutMs>`, and the text after that is split
at the first `|` into title and detail:

```text
panmessage add 0 kiwi 0 Waiting for KiwiSDR receiver slot|Receiver channels are full; AetherSDR will reconnect automatically.
panmessage add 0 tx 2500 tone=warning Transmit disabled|Transmit is disabled because this panadapter is displaying a KiwiSDR receiver.
panmessage list 0
panmessage remove 0 kiwi
panmessage clear 0
```

Targets are a `panIndex` from `dumpTree`, `active`, a `SpectrumWidget`
`objectName`, or a radio pan id (`0x...`). Use `grab pan-visible <index>` to
capture the operator-visible stack, including the close buttons.

Messages with `timeoutMs > 0` render a small countdown badge on the card and
report the same value in the `countdown` snapshot field.

> ⚠️ **This verb shares the production overlay.** The same overlay carries
> owner-managed cards — the KiwiSDR `kiwi.connection` status card and the
> `interlock.active` "Transmit disabled" warning. Consequences for tests:
> - `panmessage clear` deletes **live** status cards too. Their producers only
>   re-post on the next state transition, so a quiet pan can be left with no
>   disconnected/interlock indicator until something changes. Prefer
>   `panmessage remove <id>` scoped to an id your test created.
> - `add` can upsert those production ids directly (e.g. forge a
>   `Transmit disabled` card, or overwrite `kiwi.connection`), indistinguishable
>   from the real path. Namespace injected ids (e.g. a `test.` prefix) so a
>   teardown `clear`/`remove` can't touch operator-facing status.

### `connect` / `disconnect`
Connect through the same dialog and model path as the visible **Connect to
Radio** workflow. Requests are scheduled onto the next Qt event-loop turn so
the bridge does not run modal connection-conflict UI inside the local-socket
read callback.

```json
→ {"cmd":"connect","action":"list"}
← {"ok":true,"count":1,"radios":[{"serial":"1234-5678","model":"FLEX-8600",
   "address":"192.168.1.50","port":4992,"status":"Available"}]}

→ {"cmd":"connect","action":"show"}
← {"ok":true,"connect":"show","requested":true,"deferred":true,"wasVisible":false}

→ {"cmd":"connect","action":"local","value":"serial 1234-5678"}
← {"ok":true,"connect":"local","selector":"serial","serial":"1234-5678",
   "requested":true,"deferred":true}

→ {"cmd":"connect","action":"ip","value":"10.0.0.25"}
← {"ok":true,"connect":"ip","target":"10.0.0.25","requested":true,"deferred":true}

→ {"cmd":"connect","action":"wait","value":30000}
← {"ok":true,"connected":true,"elapsedMs":4210,"radio":{"connected":true,...}}

→ {"cmd":"disconnect"}
← {"ok":true,"disconnect":true,"requested":true,"deferred":true}
```

Bare-line forms are also accepted:

```text
connect list
connect show
connect hide
connect local first
connect local serial 1234-5678
connect ip 10.0.0.25
connect ip 192.168.1.21 hl2
connect wait 30000
disconnect
```

`connect show` and `connect hide` idempotently show/raise or hide the
modeless **Connect to Radio** dialog for visual debugging; they do not toggle,
so `connect show` is safe when the dialog is already open. `connect local first`
captures the first currently discovered local radio's serial before scheduling
the request, so the response and deferred connect target stay consistent.
`connect local serial <serial>` selects by discovery serial. `connect ip
<host-or-ip> [flex|hl2|icom]` uses the manual **Connect by IP** probe path; if the
probe finds a radio, the panel emits its normal `connectRequested` signal and
`MainWindow` performs the standard Multi-Flex/client-slot checks before
`RadioModel` connects.

The optional radio type selects which wire protocol to probe, matching the
dialog's **Radio type** dropdown: `flex` opens the TCP/4992 command plane, `hl2`
sends a directed HPSDR Protocol 1 discovery datagram to UDP/1024, and `icom`
uses the CI-V backend. They are disjoint — a Hermes-Lite 2 never answers the
Flex probe and vice versa — so an address is only reached with the right type.
A directed HL2 probe is the only way to reach a Hermes-Lite 2 that discovery
broadcasts cannot see (VPN, routed subnet), and it is bounded at ~600 ms.

**Omit the type and discovery decides.** If the address appears in `connect
list`, that entry's `family` is used, so `connect ip <addr>` reaches an HL2
without the caller having to know it is one. Only an address nothing has
advertised falls back to the connect dialog's current selection — which is what
every pre-existing `connect ip <addr>` script relied on, and still does for
routed/off-subnet radios. The response carries both `"family"` (the type
actually used, or `"dialog"` when it was left to the selector) and
`"familySource"`: `"argument"`, `"discovery"` or `"dialog"`. Read
`familySource`, not `family` — `"family":"flex"` alone cannot tell a resolved
answer from a default.

**An explicit type always wins, including against discovery** — it is you saying you know
what is at that address, which is the whole point of being able to pass it. When the two
disagree the reply carries `"discoveryFamily"` (present whenever discovery had an opinion
at all), so a caller that wants strictness compares it against `"family"` and decides for
itself, while a caller working around a wrong discovery entry still gets through. The
mismatch is also logged.

<a id="connectstate"></a>
**`radio.connectState`** — `"idle"`, `"connecting"` or `"connected"`. The
`connected` bool is unchanged and existing scripts need no edit; this is a third
value beside it, because the bool cannot express the middle state. A caller that
issues `connect ip` and then reads `connected: false` gets the same answer
whether the connect is still working or nothing is happening at all, which is
the whole of #5413 item 3.

It is derived from the same model lifecycle as `connect wait`'s `phase`
below — set when RadioModel starts a connection attempt (for example, in
`connectToRadio()`), cleared when it lands, fails or is abandoned. `connected` wins whenever the link is up,
whatever order the underlying edges arrive in.

The field describes the model's current attempt, not every part of an accepted
connect command: address probing before `connectToRadio()` may still report
`idle`. Retry backoff after a failed attempt also reports `idle`; the flag is
re-armed when the retry starts. An `idle` reading therefore does not by itself
prove that the deferred command has failed or that no retry is scheduled.

This is the polling form of what `connect wait` blocks for: use `wait` when you
can hold a request open, and `assert_state` / `wait_for` on
`radio.connectState` when you cannot.

`connect wait <timeout_ms>` holds that request's response until the radio
connects, the connect fails, or the timeout expires — the preferred unattended
"request then assert" flow.

A reply that is not `connected` carries `"phase"`: `"connecting"` means an
attempt is still in flight and waiting again is the right move; `"idle"` means
no model attempt is currently active, including the probing and retry-backoff
windows described above. **This matters on the HL2**, which queues a connect
behind its DSP open and re-drives it later, so
a wait can legitimately expire on a connect that then succeeds. A connect that
fails outright returns immediately with the backend's own message instead of
running out the clock.

Because every connect verb answers `{"ok":true,"deferred":true}` before its real
work runs, a failure afterwards used to be visible only in the log. The wait
reply now also carries `"lastError"` and `"lastErrorAgeMs"` — the last deferred
connect/disconnect failure and how long ago it happened. It is **scoped to the current
attempt**: a connect that lands retires it, and so does scheduling a fresh one, so its
presence means this attempt has a failure behind it rather than "something went wrong at
some point since the process started". A failed `disconnect` is recorded there too, but
never completes an in-flight `connect wait` — its message belongs to the disconnect.

### `streams`
Radio-side display-stream inventory + leak detector (#3856). `get pans` can never
show a radio-side leak — the client tears down its own view on the radio's
`removed` echo, so it always looks clean. This verb reports two **independent
radio-authoritative** views, plus a reset:

**`streams` — Layer A (VITA-49 UDP truth).** Streams the radio is *still
transmitting* for an id the client no longer owns: a stream we once registered
and let go of that keeps arriving (e.g. a panafall closed without `display
panafall remove`, on firmware that keeps streaming — the #268 class).

```json
→ {"cmd":"streams"}
← {"ok":true,"scope":"udp",
   "registeredPanStreams":["0x40000000"],
   "registeredWfStreams":["0x42000000"],
   "orphanStreams":[{"streamId":"0x42000001","kind":"waterfall","packets":214,"age_ms":48}],
   "orphanCount":1}
```
An orphan whose `packets` climbs across reads with small `age_ms` is a **live
leak**; one that stops growing was a brief in-flight tail. (Keyed off
*ever-registered ∧ not-now-registered*, so it stays detectable after `pan close
all` and never mis-flags a freshly-created stream's registration lag.)

**`streams radio` — Layer B (status-bookkeeping truth).** The radio's full
display-object set (every pan + waterfall it reports, accumulated from status and
pruned on `removed`), classified `ours` / `foreign` / `orphan`, with **leaked
waterfalls** = those whose parent panadapter no longer exists. This catches the
resource-level lingering Layer A *can't* see — a waterfall the radio keeps
allocated but no longer streams (the #3843 case on firmware that stops the UDP on
pan-removal).

```json
→ {"cmd":"streams","action":"radio"}
← {"ok":true,"scope":"radio",
   "pans":[{"panId":"0x40000000","clientHandle":"0x5a3","ownership":"ours"}],
   "waterfalls":[
     {"waterfallId":"0x42000000","clientHandle":"0x5a3","ownership":"ours","parentPanId":"0x40000000","parentMissing":false},
     {"waterfallId":"0x42000001","clientHandle":"0x5a3","ownership":"orphan","parentPanId":"0x40000001","parentMissing":true}],
   "radioPanCount":1,"radioWaterfallCount":2,
   "orphanPanCount":0,"orphanWaterfallCount":1,"foreignPanCount":0,"foreignWaterfallCount":0,
   "leakedWaterfalls":["0x42000001"],"leakCount":1}
```

**`streams reset`** — clear the Layer-A orphan tally to re-baseline a before/after
measurement.

| `action` | layer | effect |
|---|---|---|
| — (default) | A | UDP-orphan inventory: registered streams + orphan streams (`streamId`, `kind`, `packets`, `age_ms`) |
| `radio` (alias `inventory`) | B | radio-authoritative display-object set: pans + waterfalls classified ours/foreign/orphan, plus `leakedWaterfalls` |
| `resync` (alias `refresh`) | B | re-subscribe (`sub pan all`) to force the radio to re-dump every display object, then re-poll `streams radio` |
| `reset` | A | clear the orphan tally |

**`streams resync`** closes the one gap Layer B can't see on its own: a waterfall
the radio keeps allocated as a resource but no longer streams, *and* whose
client-side view was already torn down (so both layers looked clean). It
re-subscribes so the radio re-dumps its present-tense set; the response is just a
trigger — re-poll `streams radio` after it settles to read the refreshed
inventory.

```json
→ {"cmd":"streams","action":"resync"}
← {"ok":true,"scope":"radio","resync":"requested",
   "hint":"re-poll 'streams radio' after ~500ms for the refreshed set"}
```

The `~500ms` is a **best-effort hint, not a contract** — the re-dump is async; if
`streams radio` still looks stale, poll again. Returns
`not connected — cannot resync display inventory` with no radio.

None of the `streams` actions keys the transmitter. In **Observe only** mode,
the default Layer-A inventory and `radio`/`inventory` reads remain available;
`reset`, `resync`, and `refresh` are blocked. `reset` changes the local orphan
tally, while `resync`/`refresh` send the `sub pan all` subscription command to
the radio.

### `devices`
External-device diagnostics and bounded lifecycle control. `devices list`
reports the available diagnostic names; `devices ulanzi` probes the exact
macOS HID match used by the Ulanzi backend and joins that inventory with the
backend's access and system-event suppression state. The inventory is limited
to devices selected by the production VID/PID dictionary.

```json
→ {"cmd":"devices","action":"ulanzi"}
← {"ok":true,"diagnostic":"ulanzi","platform":"macos","supported":true,
   "enabled":true,
   "productionMatch":{"vendorId":65521,"productId":130},
   "matchedCount":1,
   "matchedDevices":[{"product":"Ulanzi Dial","vendorId":65521,
                      "productId":130,"primaryUsagePage":1,
                      "primaryUsage":6}],
   "inventoryAvailable":true,"accessMode":"shared",
   "exclusiveOpenStatus":"notPrivileged","sharedOpenStatus":"success",
   "systemEventsSuppressed":true,"suppressionStatus":"active",
   "previousMappingPreserved":true,"eventSystemClientRetained":true,
   "connected":true,"deviceName":"Ulanzi Dial"}
```

`matchedCount` is the number of devices currently inside the production match
dictionary; `matchedDevices` exposes the selected devices' identity and primary
usage for audit. `inventoryAvailable` describes the temporary read-only
inventory query, while `exclusiveOpen*`, `sharedOpen*`, and `accessMode`
describe the real backend's access attempts. If macOS rejects an exclusive
claim for the Bluetooth keyboard-class dial, the backend opens only the exact
matched device in shared mode and applies a device-scoped system key mapping.
`systemEventsSuppressed` and `suppressionStatus` report that state;
`previousMappingPreserved` and `eventSystemClientRetained` are the restoration
ownership guards.

`devices ulanzi-stop` restores the prior mapping and closes the backend;
`devices ulanzi-start` starts it again. These lifecycle actions are blocked in
Observe only mode. A successful stop reports `restorationStatus:"success"`,
`systemEventsSuppressed:false`, and `eventSystemClientRetained:false`.

The read-only diagnostic is available in **Observe only** mode; none of these
actions keys the transmitter.

On **Linux and Windows** the snapshot and the lifecycle actions answer
differently, because only the snapshot is macOS-specific:

- A bare `devices ulanzi` query returns `ok:false` with `supported:false` and
  an `error` naming what is available instead. Those backends have no
  `diagnostics()`, so the question cannot be answered here -- it is reported as
  a refusal rather than as a success carrying no data.
- `devices ulanzi-start` and `devices ulanzi-stop` **do** run on these
  platforms and return `ok:true` with `operation`, `enabled`, and `queued`.
  No `supported` field appears on a lifecycle reply: no snapshot was asked
  for, so there is nothing for it to describe.

`queued` is present on every platform and reports whether the call was posted
to another thread rather than run inline. It is `true` on Linux and Windows,
where the backend lives on the ExtControllers thread, so the reply is an
acknowledgement that the request was accepted -- not a statement that it has
completed. On macOS the backend stays on the main thread alongside the bridge
handler, so the call runs inline, `queued` is `false`, and the returned
snapshot reflects the state *after* it. A lifecycle request is refused with
`ok:false` and `queued:false` when the backend thread is absent or stopped.
A build without a concrete backend (for example Windows without HIDAPI) also
refuses lifecycle requests with `ok:false` and `supported:false`. A queued
acknowledgement does not guarantee delivery if the thread subsequently exits.

### `memprofile`
Cross-platform process and subsystem memory profiling for long-running leak
investigations. An instant snapshot combines the operating system's native
process counters with explicitly sized application buffers and lightweight
QObject lifecycle inventories:

```json
→ {"cmd":"memprofile","action":"snapshot"}
← {"ok":true,"schemaVersion":1,
   "process":{"residentMetric":"physicalFootprint","residentBytes":412876800,
              "privateBytes":355205120,"allocatorInUseBytes":287309824,
              "trackedSubsystemBytes":94781440,"unattributedResidentBytes":318095360},
   "subsystems":{
     "panadapter":{"trackedBytes":89128960,"estimatedGpuBytes":7549747,
                   "objectCount":143,"classes":{"SpectrumWidget":1},"details":{"panCount":1}},
     "audio":{"trackedBytes":65536,"objectCount":42},
     "radioModels":{"trackedBytes":0,"objectCount":71},
     "gui":{"trackedBytes":0,"objectCount":2610},
     "automation":{"trackedBytes":5586944,"objectCount":12}}}
```

`residentMetric` deliberately follows the number operators see in the native
task monitor: Working Set on Windows, physical footprint on macOS, and VmRSS on
Linux. `privateBytes`, allocator counters, virtual size, thread count, and
handle count appear where that OS exposes them. They are useful within one OS;
they are not byte-for-byte comparable across operating systems.

The sampler is bounded and off until explicitly started:

```text
memprofile start 5000 10000   # sample every 5 s, retain at most 10,000 points
memprofile status             # current snapshot + compact trend report
memprofile sample             # force an extra point now
memprofile report             # compact report, no raw points
memprofile samples            # compact report + retained raw points
memprofile stop               # final point + compact report
memprofile reset              # stop and release the retained series
```

JSON requests use `action` and, for `start`, `value: "<intervalMs>
<maxSamples>"`. The interval is bounded to 250–3,600,000 ms and retention to
2–10,000 samples so the profiler cannot become the leak. Five-second sampling
holds about 13.8 hours; use 30–60 seconds for multi-day runs.

Each byte/count trend reports `first`, `last`, `delta`, `min`, `max`, a linear
per-hour slope, and `rSquared`. `sustainedGrowth` is a triage heuristic only: at
least six samples over at least one minute, ≥4 MiB net byte growth, positive
slope, and R² ≥0.5. `growthSuspects` collects metrics meeting that bar;
`classCountGrowth` shows retained or released QObject classes by subsystem.
Correlate the two:

- rising `subsystem.panadapter.trackedBytes` identifies retained waterfall/3DSS
  buffers;
- a growing `SpectrumWidget`/panadapter class count identifies lifecycle leaks;
- rising process resident/private bytes with flat tracked subsystems points to
  an uninstrumented native, allocator, Qt, driver, or GPU allocation;
- a positive slope with low R² is usually warm-up/cache/noise, not proof of a
  leak. Extend the run and reproduce the same slope before fixing anything.

Tracked subsystem bytes are deliberately honest lower bounds. They do not claim
to attribute every heap allocation, and GPU surface estimates are excluded from
resident attribution. GUI object counts include panadapter objects, so object
counts are scoped diagnostics and are not additive.

Use the companion driver for unattended runs; it writes the final report and
raw series atomically, records the bridge identity, and warns when the process
has the independent TX-automation rail armed (the soak never invokes TX):

```bash
python3 tools/memory_soak.py --duration 300 --interval 5 \
  --output /tmp/aethersdr-memory-5m.json
```

For a repeatable cross-band soak, the driver can also cycle the active slice
and panadapter through RX frequencies. The first frequency is applied
immediately, each change is marked in the bridge log, and the tune responses
are retained in the output JSON alongside the memory series:

```bash
python3 tools/memory_soak.py --duration 3600 --interval 5 \
  --tune-interval 600 \
  --tune-frequencies 3.573,7.074,14.074,21.074,28.074,50.313 \
  --output aethersdr-memory-1h.json
```

`tune` and `pan center` are RX/config-only bridge actions; this cycle never
keys the transmitter. A refused VFO lock or pan-center request is printed as a
failure and preserved in `tuneEvents` rather than being silently ignored.

The MCP server exposes the same surface as `memory_profile`.

### `txwaterfall`
Toggle the radio's **show-TX-in-waterfall** display flag (`transmit set
show_tx_in_waterfall`), which gates whether keyed-up TX renders FFT-derived rows
in the waterfall. Off by default; enable it so a test can confirm CWX / tune /
ATU energy appears in the waterfall, not just in the FFT trace. This is a display
toggle — it does **not** key the transmitter.

```json
→ {"cmd":"txwaterfall","value":"on"}
← {"ok":true,"txwaterfall":true,"note":"radio echoes status; re-read with get transmit showTxInWaterfall"}
```

Accepts `on`/`off` (also `1`/`0`, `true`/`false`, `enable`/`disable`). The radio
echoes the change asynchronously — re-read with `get transmit showTxInWaterfall`.

### `get dax`
Read the centralized DAX RX channel-ownership table (#3305): which consumers
(`bridge` / `tci` / `rade`) hold each channel, the radio-side stream id, and
whether a `stream create` is in flight — plus each slice's `dax=` assignment.
This is the assertion surface for DAX/TCI lifecycle tests: storm regressions
(#4009), co-hold survival across a bridge or TCI teardown (#3363), and
grace-window stream removal, all without log-grepping.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"dax"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"dax",
   "channels":[{"channel":1,"streamId":"0x4000008","createPending":false,
                "holders":["bridge","tci"]}],
   "slices":[{"sliceId":0,"daxChannel":1}]}
```

Semantics to assert against: a channel with holders and `streamId=0x0` +
`createPending=true` is mid-create; a channel with a stream and **no** holders
is inside the 1.5 s removal grace window (it disappears once the removal
lands); a channel entry that persists with holders across a consumer teardown
proves the co-hold path.

### `get txtimer`
Read the status-bar transmit timer's state. The timer sits just left of the
**PC Audio** button and runs **only** for operator-driven phone/data transmits
— MOX, local/hardware PTT, footswitch, VOX — and deliberately **not** for
TUNE/two-tone carriers, internal ATU tuning, TCI-hardware or DAX transmits
(external-app keying paths), **nor CW** (break-in/QSK toggles the interlock per
element, which would thrash a wall-clock timer). These exclusions are gated in
`RadioModel::operatorTransmitChanged`. It is hidden when idle; on unkey it
holds the final elapsed reading for 15 s, then fades out.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"txtimer"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"txtimer","visible":true,"running":true,"holding":false,
   "fading":false,"elapsedMs":4210,"text":"0:04","opacity":1.0}
```

Fields: `visible` (label shown at all), `running` (keyed, counting up),
`holding` (the 15 s post-unkey hold is armed), `fading` (fade-out animation in
flight), `elapsedMs` / `text` (live while running, frozen at unkey), `opacity`
(1.0 while shown/holding, ramps to 0 during fade). A trailing property narrows
it: `get txtimer running` → `{"value":true}`. Assertion shapes: after a 1 W
dummy-load MOX key, `running=true` + `elapsedMs` climbing; after unkey,
`running=false`, `holding=true`, `text` frozen; ~15 s later `fading=true` then
`visible=false`. A TUNE, two-tone, ATU, DAX, TCI, or CW transmit must leave
`visible=false` throughout.

### `tci`
In-process TCI **client** simulator. Connects to this app's own TCI server
over loopback and offers two profiles after draining the init burst through
`ready;`:

- Default/WSJT-X: sends `audio_samplerate:48000;` + `audio_start:0;` and counts
  binary RX-audio frames.
- SDC: sends `iq_samplerate:96000;`, `audio_samplerate:24000;`, and
  `iq_start:0;`, then separately counts type-0 IQ frames. This reproduces the
  CW-skimmer initialization path and proves the DAX IQ stream is live.

Removes the external-WebSocket dependency for TCI/DAX lifecycle testing.
Requires the TCI server to be running (toggle via `invoke tciEnable click` if
needed).

```json
→ {"cmd":"tci","action":"start"}            // optional value = port

   ]}

→ {"cmd":"tci","action":"stop","value":"abrupt"}   // omit value for graceful audio_stop + close
← {"ok":true,"action":"stop","abrupt":true,"binaryFrames":412, …}
```

The same commands have bare forms:

```text
tci send split_enable:0,false;vfo:0,1,14076000;
tci trace start
tci trace status 50
tci trace stop
tci trace clear
tci trace export /tmp/tci-trace.json
tci routes
```

The `ptt` counters and ages are payload-free and remain available without TCI
wire tracing. If `onRequestCount` advances but `acceptedOnCount` does not, the
request stopped in TCI routing or transmit preflight. If both advance but
`confirmedOnCount` does not and `confirmationTimeoutCount` advances, TCI handed
the request to the radio path but radio-authoritative keyed state never returned.
Read that snapshot beside `civ incident`: together they distinguish WebSocket
ingress, TCI routing, CI-V scheduling, the serial data pipe, the RS-BA1 lease,
and broad UDP/socket loss.

For Icom, `unkeySettleCount` counts the bounded TCI presentation barriers used
after an owned unkey. A growing `suppressedRekeyCount` means delayed CI-V
readback briefly said the radio was still keyed; AetherSDR kept that truth in
the model/UI while withholding the transient TCI re-key. If no accepted CI-V
PTT-off readback arrives within 500 ms, `unkeySettleTimeoutCount` advances,
ownership is retained, and `trx:true` is published again. The optimistic local
unkey edge never counts as radio confirmation.

`lastDisconnect` survives after `clientCount` reaches zero. It retains the
WebSocket close code/reason, socket error, session age, last text-message ages,
and command names only (arguments and binary payloads are not retained). The
nested PTT snapshot is taken before fail-closed disconnect cleanup, preserving
whether the departing client owned a pending or confirmed transmit session.

### Multiple simulated clients

Several simulators can run at once, so a test can stand up the two-WSJT-X
shape #4547 is about: two instances, one per slice, each declaring its own
receiver. `@id` names a client and `rx=N` sets the receiver it declares in
`audio_start` (and `iq_start` on the `sdc` profile). Both are optional —
every single-client spelling above behaves exactly as before, under the
default id `a`.

```text
tci start @a rx=0            # WSJT-X instance on receiver 0
tci start @b rx=1            # WSJT-X instance on receiver 1
tci send @b trx:0,true,tci   # key from B — B's declared receiver decides the slice
tci status                   # clientCount + a per-client array
tci status @b                # one client
tci stop @a abrupt           # tear down one; the other keeps running
tci stop all                 # tear down every client
```

`@id` must be 1–32 alphanumerics (`-` and `_` allowed) and must be unique
among running clients; starting a duplicate is refused rather than leaking a
socket. TCI commands never begin with `@`, so the prefix cannot collide with
a payload. Trace entries carry a `client` field, so a two-client transcript
stays readable.

The receiver each client declares is not cosmetic: it is the only per-client
signal the TCI wire carries, and it is what decides which slice that client's
PTT keys (see [TCI Receiver Index Policy](architecture/tci-receivers.md)).
Every WSJT-X instance addresses `trx:0` regardless, so a two-client test that
does not set distinct `rx=` values is not testing routing at all.

**A two-slice radio is required to exercise this end to end.** The demo
(`SimBackend`) advertises a single slice, so it can host two TCI clients but
cannot show them keying different slices; that half needs real hardware or a
multi-slice backend.

`send` writes one raw client WebSocket frame, adding a final semicolon when
needed. Embedded CR/LF and commands over 4096 characters are rejected.
`trace start` resets sequence numbering and captures every semicolon-delimited
command in both directions in a bounded 512-entry buffer. `trace export`
atomically writes the complete retained transcript as JSON.

`routes` is a read-only snapshot of the server's stable Flex slice routing,
including route ownership (`external` or `tci-created`),
transition/deferred-command state, PTT ownership, and the current contiguous
TCI receiver projection. `lastRouteError` records the latest route allocation
or TX-selection failure; when no VFO-B slice can be created, the server also
returns the authoritative channel-1 projection so a client does not wait for a
missing acknowledgement. `tci status` and `tci routes` remain available when
the bridge is in observe-only mode; `send`, trace control/export, start, and
stop are blocked.

`stop abrupt` closes the socket without `audio_stop` or `iq_stop`; graceful
stop sends the command matching the selected profile. This lets tests assert
the relevant DAX cleanup. For the SDC profile, `iqFrames` climbing is the
"skimmer IQ is actually flowing" assertion. For the default profile,
`binaryFrames` climbing at a steady rate (~47/s at 48 kHz) proves RX audio is
flowing. `msSinceLastFrame` spiking while the selected stream is started means
that stream went silent.

### `get sync`
Read the Receive Sync state used by the spectrum overlay and Auto Assist
(`sync`, alias `receiveSync`).

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"sync"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"sync","status":"locked",
   "effectiveOffsetMs":470,"candidateResidualMs":0,
   "candidateConfidence":0.54,"candidatePeakCorrelation":0.77}
```

Useful fields:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `status` / `statusText` | `searching`, `locked`, `coasting`, etc. |
| `effectiveOffsetMs` | Applied presentation offset; positive delays Flex relative to Kiwi |
| `candidateResidualMs` | Latest measured residual at the output-stage estimator point |
| `candidateAbsoluteOffsetMs` | Current applied offset plus residual candidate |
| `candidateConfidence` / `candidatePeakCorrelation` | Matcher quality for the latest estimate |
| `stableEstimateCount` | Count of consecutive near-equal candidate offsets |
| `lastAcceptedLock` | Whether the latest estimator pass changed/confirmed the applied lock |
| `flex*BufferMs`, `kiwi*BufferMs`, `playbackQueuedMs` | Current live-to-ear staging counters |

### `get clock`
Read the AetherClock time-signal decode snapshot (engine + voter state for the
WWV/WWVH/WWVB decoders). Served before the radio guard, so it answers even
while disconnected; until the GUI wires a model it replies
`"no clock model available"`.

```json
→ {"cmd":"get","model":"clock"}
← {"ok":true,"model":"clock","state":2,"stateName":"Locked",
   "station":1,"stationName":"WWV","decodedUtc":"2026-07-20T22:52:59.000Z",
   "offsetMs":-129.7,"lockQuality":75,"sliceId":0,"gpsTimeAvailable":false}
```

Useful fields:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `state` / `stateName` | `NoSignal`, `Acquiring`, `Locked` — the authoritative currency signal |
| `station` / `stationName` | Auto-tagged station: WWV / WWVH / WWVB |
| `decodedUtc` | Last voted broadcast time (ISO-8601; empty until a first decode). Retained after demotion so age-since-decode stays computable — always read it beside `stateName` |
| `offsetMs` | decoded − host at the second edge; positive = host behind broadcast |
| `lockQuality` | Voter lock confidence 0–100 (weakest-voted-bit semantics) |
| `sliceId` | Bound slice while running, −1 when stopped |
| `gpsTimeAvailable` | Whether the connected radio reports GPS time (context for the offset) |

Acquisition telemetry (additive; mirrors the engine's ~1 Hz `ClockDiagnostics`
snapshot — every value is a real measurement or a real gate verdict, updated
while the engine runs):

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `toneSnrDb` | Stage 1 carrier readout: WWVB tone-search peak/median in dB; WWV/WWVH folded tick-band peak-to-mean in dB |
| `pwmContrast` | WWVB envelope p90/p10 contrast (0 when n/a); ≥ ~1.4 means a real AM drop exists |
| `toneDetected` | Carrier gate result (WWVB tone gate / WWV tick-fold lock) |
| `phaseLocked` | Second-edge timing sync (WWV tick lock / WWVB envelope phase) |
| `delayEstMs` | WWV tracked matched-filter delay estimate; `null` when the decoder has none |
| `anchored` | Minute frame anchored (marker sync) |
| `badFrameStreak` | Consecutive broken-marker-skeleton frames (WWV; 3 triggers resync) |
| `classifiedPct` | % of the last 60 s that classified into a symbol |
| `framesInWindow` / `windowSize` | Voter sliding-window occupancy |
| `voteQuality` | Raw voter lock confidence 0–1 (pre-scale; `lockQuality` is the 0–100 post-lock mirror) |
| `refusalReason` / `refusalName` | Which lock gate is currently refusing: `None`, `QualityFloor`, `Plausibility`, `Staleness`, `Contested` (`None` = locked or still collecting frames) |

### `audioCapture`
Bounded, automation-only PCM capture for receive-sync diagnostics. It is active
only inside an `AETHER_AUTOMATION=1` process, is read-only, and does not change

Capture points:

| point | contents |
|---|---|
| `raw` | Flex/Kiwi float32 stereo PCM as it enters AudioEngine, useful for arrival-timing diagnostics |
| `post` | Source-tagged Flex/Kiwi float32 stereo after client DSP/resampling, just before each source output FIFO |
| `output` | Source-tagged Flex/Kiwi float32 stereo as the final mixer consumes each source FIFO; this is the Auto Assist estimator timing point |
| `final` | Final mixed float32 stereo bytes accepted by the RX audio sink |

The JSON file contains chunks with `point`, `source`, optional `sourceId`,
`sampleRate`, `channels`, `format: "float32le"`, `startNs`, `frames`, and
base64 `pcmBase64`. Use `audioCapture status` for metadata only and
`audioCapture stop` to stop early.

#### DSP stereo probe: NR2, NR4, MNR, DFNR, BNR, NNR

`audioCapture probeDspStereo <mode>` (or `all`, optionally with `strict`) runs
the same deterministic three-second stereo signal through three fresh filters
of that method: once as generated, once with the right channel replaced by
unrelated tones, and once with the left replaced. Every client NR method
denoises L and R independently, as RN2 does, so `ok` means each side's output
is bit-identical whatever the other side carries (`leftIndependent`,
`rightIndependent`, `channelsIndependent`) and both sides stay `audible`.

The RMS `input`/`output`, `ratioError`, and level-ratio fields are reported
but not judged: independent, level-dependent suppression treats the louder
and quieter copies of one off-centre signal differently, so the L/R balance
is not held (see the RX DSP ordering in `docs/architecture/audio-pipeline.md`). These modes no longer
return `preserved`, the old L/R-ratio verdict; read `channelsIndependent` and
`ok` instead (RN2 keeps `preserved`). `leftIndependenceMaxError` and
`rightIndependenceMaxError` give the largest per-sample difference behind each
verdict, or `-1` when the runs differ in length or produced no output. The NR2 run disables post2, whose per-instance random comfort noise
would otherwise make the three runs differ, and says so with
`post2Disabled: true`. A method that removes the probe's
steady tones entirely (BNR does) reports `audible: false`.

#### RN2 deterministic stereo probe

`audioCapture probeDspStereo RN2` is an automation-only, synthetic RX proof
surface for RN2. It creates a deterministic three-second stereo float32 signal
inside `AudioEngine`; it neither connects to a radio nor changes RX routing,
playback, TX permission, or TX state. It may take up to 120 seconds through the
automation bridge because it deliberately runs a selected filter and a fresh,
aligned reference filter.

The two temporary filters use `probeDryMix=1.0`, reported in the response. That
keeps the proof independent of a user's RN2 strength and of whether RNNoise
classifies the synthetic tones as speech: RNNoise still executes its frame,
resampler, accumulator, channel-mode, and FIFO paths, while this probe measures
those transport contracts rather than denoising quality. Production RX/TX RN2
settings and DSP behavior are untouched.

The legacy no-option form remains unchanged, including its 24 kHz / 960-frame
RX-compatible defaults. `probeNr2Stereo` is the older SpectralNR/`NR2` alias;
it is not an RN2 spelling and still takes no RN2 options.

```text
# Legacy RX-compatible run with an irregular cyclic partition sequence.
python tools/automation_probe.py audioCapture probeDspStereo RN2 blocks=73,211,17,604,91

# Native 48 kHz, stereo-preserving RN2.
python tools/automation_probe.py audioCapture probeDspStereo RN2 rate=Native48k output=PreserveRxStereo blocks=73,211,17,604,91

# Native 48 kHz, intentional mono/downmix path duplicated to L/R.
python tools/automation_probe.py audioCapture probeDspStereo RN2 rate=Native48k output=ProcessedMono blocks=73,211,17,604,91
```

The same request is available through JSON; the CLI driver preserves all
key/value tokens in `value`:

```json
→ {"cmd":"audioCapture","action":"probeDspStereo",
   "value":"RN2 rate=Native48k output=ProcessedMono blocks=480,960"}
```

Only `probeDspStereo RN2` accepts case-insensitive `rate`, `output`, and
`blocks` tokens. `rate` is `Legacy24k` (default) or `Native48k`; `output` is
`PreserveRxStereo` (default) or `ProcessedMono`; `blocks` is a bounded,
positive comma-separated cyclic list of input-frame counts (default `960`).
Unknown, repeated, non-positive, oversized, or excessive-count options fail
before running a filter. These options are rejected for `all` and every
non-RN2 mode. The legacy comma form `RN2,strict` remains valid.

Every RN2 response retains the established `frames`, `discardFrames`, RMS
`input`/`output`, `ratioError`, level-ratio, `audible`, and `preserved` fields.
It additionally reports canonical `rateDomain`, `sampleRate`, `outputMode`,
and `blockPartitions`; input/output frame and byte totals; `inputCoverage`,
`outputCoverage`, per-block `blockOutput`, and `outputSizeExact`; and the
selected/reference `firstAudibleFrame` and millisecond positions. No fixed
latency limit is asserted: those positions are evidence for the caller to
inspect. `startupLatencyDeltaFrames`/`Ms` and `startupLatencyEquivalent` make
partition-dependent leading silence explicit. `sequenceComparisonFrames`,
`sequenceMaxError`, `sequenceEquivalent`, and `sequenceOrder` compare a
substantial first-audible-aligned deterministic window against the fresh
reference run. `fifoOrderPreserved` means that aligned payload stayed in
reference order; `fifoSequenceEquivalent` is stricter and is true only when
both that payload and its startup position match the reference.
`firstOutputSizeMismatchBlock` and `sequenceFirstMismatchFrame`/`Channel` are
`-1` on a clean run and identify the first failing location otherwise.

For `PreserveRxStereo`, `ratioPreserved` is the explicit ratio-preservation
result (and `preserved` keeps its historical meaning). For `ProcessedMono`,
`leftRightMaxDelta` and `duplicated` prove that the intentional mono result was
copied to both output channels; `ok` requires audibility, exact output sizing,
duplication, and sequence equivalence. In preserve mode, `ok` also requires
the legacy stereo-ratio check.

This probe cannot expose RN2's internal one-time resampler divergence warning
latch: it is not surfaced by the public filter API, and two matched resamplers
cannot be induced to diverge through public inputs without invasive fault
injection. The output-size and aligned-reference evidence above therefore
proves the public contract, not that hidden warning-latch path.

### `floors`
Per-pan **measured FFT noise floor** and the **display floor** (dBm), read off the
live spectrum without a screenshot — the numeric way to assert post-TX floor
recovery (#3804) or that the waterfall auto-range settled.

```json
→ {"cmd":"floors"}
← {"ok":true,"floors":[{"panIndex":0,"noiseFloorDbm":-99.68,"displayFloorDbm":-99.17,"visible":true}]}
```

One entry per `SpectrumWidget` that has a real measurement; the same numbers
appear per-node in `dumpTree` (`noiseFloorDbm`/`displayFloorDbm`/`panIndex`).

### `dss`
Automation-only 3D stacked-trace / waterfall scrollback proof surface. It finds
a `SpectrumWidget` by `panIndex`, injects synthetic RX rows through the normal
SpectrumWidget waterfall paths, and returns compact counters/peak-bin snapshots.
It is RX-only: no radio commands and no transmit keying.

```json
→ {"cmd":"dss","action":"reset","target":"0","value":"native"}
← {"ok":true,"panIndex":0,"live":true,"waterfallRows":96,
   "centerMhz":14.1,"bandwidthMhz":0.192,"dssHistoryRows":0,...}

→ {"cmd":"dss","action":"inject","target":"0","value":"99 100 1 native"}
← {"ok":true,"dssHistoryRows":99,"waterfallHistoryRows":99,
   "maxHistoryOffsetRows":3,
   "dssHistoryRowsAdded":99,"waterfallHistoryRowsAdded":99,...}

→ {"cmd":"dss","action":"scrollback","target":"0","value":"1"}
← {"ok":true,"live":false,"historyOffsetRows":1,
   "maxHistoryOffsetRows":3,...}

→ {"cmd":"dss","action":"inject","target":"0","value":"3 420 0 native"}
← {"ok":true,"live":false,"dssHistoryRows":102,
   "waterfallHistoryRows":102,"historyOffsetRows":4,
   "dssHistoryRowsAdded":3,"waterfallHistoryRowsAdded":3,
   ...}

→ {"cmd":"dss","action":"scrollback","target":"0","value":"0"}
← {"ok":true,"live":false,"historyOffsetRows":0,"dssVisiblePeakBin":420,...}
```

This example assumes the reset response reports `waterfallRows:96`; for a
different widget height, inject at least `waterfallRows + 3` rows before asking
for `scrollback 1`.

Actions:

| action | value | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot` | optional pan target | Read `live`, current center/bandwidth MHz, waterfall/DSS history row counts, visible DSS row count, the current front-row peak bin/min/max/span, localized plateau metrics (`dssVisibleFrontMinValueBins`, `dssVisibleFrontLongestFlatRunBins`, and visible maxima), flat/non-flat visible-row counts, and the waterfall time-marker state (`waterfallTimeMarkerSeconds`, `waterfallTimeMarkers`). |
| `reset` | `native` or `kiwi` | Clear the selected stream's current/history rows and make that stream active for subsequent injection. |
| `inject` | `<count> <firstPeakBin> <stepBin> [native\|kiwi [rowLowMhz rowHighMhz]]` | Add synthetic rows with one strong peak per row. `count` is rejected if it exceeds the retained waterfall history capacity. Native injection adds one fallback-style waterfall/DSS row per input row; Kiwi injection drives `updateKiwiSdrWaterfallRow()`. Kiwi frame arguments override the source row's frequency span, so tests can cover partial-overlap rows. |
| `scrollback` | `<offsetRows>` | Enter waterfall history mode and rebuild the 3D surface using the same offset. |
| `live` | none | Return to live mode. |

The paused/live-history assertion is: enter `scrollback`, inject more rows,
confirm both `waterfallHistoryRowsAdded` and `dssHistoryRowsAdded` match the
injected count while `historyOffsetRows` advances and `dssVisiblePeakBin` stays
on the same paused historical row, then set `scrollback 0` and confirm the newly
injected peak becomes visible. The total row counts are still returned, but the
`*RowsAdded` fields are the deterministic assertion surface if live data is also
arriving between bridge requests.

### Waterfall time markers

`dss snapshot` reports the clock-aligned waterfall time markers (#5537):

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `waterfallTimeMarkerSeconds` | Selected interval for this pan slot, in seconds. `0` means Off (the default). Only `0`, `15`, `30`, `60`, `300`, `600` and `900` are valid; anything else fails closed to `0`. |
| `waterfallTimeMarkers` | Markers currently inside the waterfall viewport, newest first. Each entry is `{"timestampMs", "y"}`: `timestampMs` is the **clock boundary** the marker labels (always an exact multiple of the interval, never the packet arrival time), and `y` is its offset in pixels from the top of the waterfall rect. |

The interval is set from the panadapter context menu (**Waterfall Time
Markers**) and persists per pan slot in the `Display` settings document. It is
not settable over the bridge; seed `DisplaySettings` or use the menu.

Markers are attached to the signal row that was captured when the boundary was
crossed, so they scroll with the waterfall rather than with wall-clock time.
Two useful assertions:

- Every `timestampMs` is divisible by `waterfallTimeMarkerSeconds * 1000`.
- A marker's `y` advances at `1000 / waterfallTimeScaleMsPerRow` pixels per
  second while live, and holds still under `dss scrollback`.

An empty array is normal: a screenful of waterfall is only
`waterfallRows * waterfallTimeScaleMsPerRow` milliseconds deep (typically
11-19 s), so intervals longer than that window have no marker on screen most
of the time.

To reproduce a low-coverage Kiwi row, read `centerMhz` and `bandwidthMhz` from
`dss snapshot`, then inject a Kiwi source row whose span overlaps less than 5%
of the current view. For example, with `viewHigh = centerMhz + bandwidthMhz/2`,
`dss inject 3 120 0 kiwi <viewHigh - 0.03*bandwidthMhz> <viewHigh + 0.97*bandwidthMhz>`
keeps row counts aligned while proving the DSS history stores the partial row
content instead of a flat fallback row.

### `whoami`
Identify **this** bridge instance among concurrent bridges (each app process gets
its own per-pid socket + discovery entry).

```json
→ {"cmd":"whoami"}
← {"ok":true,"pid":34758,"name":"aethersdr-automation-34758",
   "socket":"/var/folders/…/aethersdr-automation-34758",
   "label":"","station":"Automation","agentName":"Automation",
   "txAllowed":false,"version":"26.6.5"}
```

`txAllowed` reports whether `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX` is set for this process —
check it before assuming a keying verb will work. `label` is
`AETHER_AUTOMATION_LABEL` (a human tag for the instance).

### `health`
The **radio's** view of itself — the same rows the Radio Health dialog shows,
which until now reached nothing else and so were unavailable to a script or a
regression test. Read-only: it keys nothing and sets nothing.

Two sources, merged when both are in play: the connected backend, and (for a
family that has one) a **stream-free source** that keeps answering when the
backend has stopped talking to the radio — see `telemetry` below. The **backend
wins every key collision**, because an in-band reading arrives on our own
cadence and an out-of-band probe does not; the stream-free source fills the gaps
and owns the rows that say which path spoke. A key the winner declares but
leaves out of its values means "not reported" and does **not** erase a value the
other side has.

```json
→ {"cmd":"health"}
← {"ok":true,"connected":true,"rows":[
     {"key":"micLevel","section":"Transmit voice chain",
      "label":"Mic slider (0-100, 50 = unity)","value":80},
     {"key":"micGainAppliedLinear",
      "label":"Mic gain at the modulator (linear)","value":15.849},
     {"key":"rfPowerPercent","label":"Drive requested (0-100)","value":60},
     {"key":"txDriveRegister","label":"Drive written (raw 0-255)","value":153},
     {"key":"txDriveGated","label":"Drive held at 0 by the TX gate","value":false},
     {"key":"forwardPowerPeakW",
      "label":"Forward (W, approx — peak HOLD, display only)","value":4.56}]}
```

**`spectrumGapDiscards<n>` counts discarded FFT windows, not packet loss.**
On HL2 there is one row per active receiver. It increments when a transport
sequence discontinuity discards a nonempty spectrum accumulator, including
accepted rewinds and duplicate packets. `droppedPackets` counts forward packet
loss only. The two can differ in either direction: a discontinuity at an empty
accumulator costs no window, while a rewind can discard a window without
increasing the loss count. The reset prevents a transform across discontinuous
samples; the counter records that prevention, not a corrupted frame rendered.
Repeated discontinuities can prevent a full FFT window from forming and leave
the last trace displayed, so use frame liveness as well as counter deltas when
assessing a measurement run.

`spectrumGapDiscards<n>` is monotonic for the receiver DSP object's lifetime.
A sample-rate change reconfigures that object in place and does not reset the
count. Only destroying and rebuilding the receiver DSP starts it at zero.
Compare deltas across a run; do not switch geometry to zero the counter. A
receiver without a DSP reports `null`, meaning unavailable rather than clean.
ANAN has the same DSP counter but does not publish health rows yet.

**Assert on `forwardPowerW`, never on `forwardPowerPeakW`.** The peak row is a
meter's display hold: a single key-edge ADC sample decays over seconds, so a
script that asserts on it reads a transient from the start of the over as
though it were the power now. It is reset at each key edge, which is right for
a needle and wrong for a test.

On the HL2, `rfPowerPercent` / `txDriveRegister` / `txDriveGated` are the
requested-versus-applied pair for transmit drive. `txDriveRegister` is the raw
value last written to the radio and is **absent until the first write** — a `0`
there means the radio was commanded to zero drive, not that nothing has
happened yet. `txDriveGated` is true when the transmit gate
(`AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX` unset, or a TX-blocked session) forced the
register to 0 while the requested percent stayed where the operator left it;
without it that divergence is invisible. Note the gateware decodes only the
drive byte's top nibble, so the raw scale moves in steps of 16 — a percent
alone does not tell you which of the 16 drives the radio actually got.

**Assert on `dspFaultCountN`, not on `dspProcessFaultsN`.** The HL2 publishes
both for each receiver. `dspProcessFaultsN` is PROSE meant for the dialog —
`"none"`, or `"3 - WDSP engine error 3"` — and its format is a presentation
choice that may change; a script matching on it is matching on wording.
`dspFaultCountN` is the same fact as an integer, and is what a threshold or a
soak test wants. Both are `null` until the receiver has processed a block, which
is distinct from zero: "no faults" and "no DSP yet" are different answers.

The companion rows are `dspBlocksN` (blocks WDSP turned into audio) and
`dspUnderrunsN` (the pipeline had no input ready). **Underruns are not faults**
and are counted separately on purpose — an underrun is the normal shape of a
starved pipeline, while a fault is WDSP refusing data it was given. Summing them
turns a healthy idle radio into a broken one. `N` is the zero-based receiver
index, so a single-receiver radio publishes `dspBlocks0` and no suffix appears
in the label.

**This is deliberately not assembled from the models, and that is the whole
point.** `get` already reports those, and a model reports what the operator
**asked for** — so a control whose command was dropped on the way to the radio
reads back as though it worked. Every row here comes from the backend instead,
so the two can be compared and the comparison is the diagnosis. The HL2's mic
gain was exactly that failure: the slider moved, every readback agreed, and the
modulator never heard about it.

`rows` is ordered as the dialog renders it; `section` appears on the first row
of each group and is absent on the rest. A `value` of `null` means **the radio
is not reporting this** — either it never did, or what it last reported has
expired and is no longer being measured. Either way it is distinct from a zero:
"the FIFO is empty" and "we were never told" are different answers, and
collapsing them is what makes a readout unable to detect its own failure. An
empty `rows` array with `"ok":true` is a real state too: nothing connected and
no stream-free source aimed, or a family that publishes no health rows. Check
`connected` to tell those apart.

**Where a row can expire, a companion age row tells you which silence it is.**
The HL2's four converter rows — `adcPeakDbfs`, `adcRmsDbfs`, `adcCrestDb` and
`adcClippedPerBlock` — come from a gated sensor, and they go `null` once the
newest block has stopped describing now, which includes the whole of any
transmission longer than about three seconds. `adcObservedAgoMs` is deliberately
**not** expired with them: a `null` beside an age of `46810` means *reported,
then expired*, while a `null` beside a `null` age means *never reported*. A
script that reads these must treat `null` as a refusal to answer rather than as
a number it can coerce.

**Reading `health` is itself a demand signal.** A stream-free source polls only
while something is watching, so each read renews a 5 s demand window and keeps
the probe running. A script that polls `health` in a loop against an aimed radio
is asking for one datagram a second; `telemetry target off` stops it.

### `telemetry`
Aim a **stream-free health source** at a radio **without connecting to it** —
the one way to ask "is anyone else using this radio", "is it powered and
reachable", or "what is its PA temperature" about a radio you are *not* holding
a session on. Read-only: it never connects, never writes to the radio, and never
takes a session.

```json
→ {"cmd":"telemetry","action":"target","value":"192.168.8.2"}
← {"ok":true,"telemetry":"target","target":"192.168.8.2","family":"hl2",
   "connected":false,"readOnly":true}

→ {"cmd":"telemetry","action":"target","value":"off"}
← {"ok":true,"telemetry":"target","target":null}
```

`target` is the only action. The rows it produces arrive through `health`, not
through this verb.

**Which families have one is a declaration, not a list here.** A family declares
a stream-free source from its own backend directory; everything above the radio
seam asks the registry. Today only `hl2` declares one — a Hermes-Lite 2 answers
discovery probes on its alternate control port whether or not anybody holds its
IQ stream. Every other family refuses the verb and its `health` is unchanged.

**The address must be a radio `connect list` can see.** The family to build is
taken from discovery rather than from whatever this session last connected to;
an address that is not a discovered radio is refused rather than probed on a
guess, because guessing is how one family's rows end up on another family's
snapshot.

Refused, each with a reason that says which: a non-literal address; IPv6 (the
poller binds an IPv4 socket, so it would count unanswered polls for datagrams
that never left); multicast, broadcast, a local segment's directed broadcast
(`192.168.50.255`), and the unspecified addresses — this sends one datagram a
second and must name a single radio; a family that declares no source; and a
session that is **already connected**, because there is one instrument and
aiming it would repoint the one the live session is reading. A connected session
is already aimed at its own radio, so nothing is lost — just read `health`.

**What it costs, stated plainly.** While aimed and while something is reading
`health`, this sends a ~60-byte UDP datagram to the named address once a second.
A mistyped address that happens to host an HPSDR-speaking device gets its first
answer believed and rendered as that radio's health; a MAC latch stops the
responder *changing* afterwards, but it cannot vet the first one. A stranger at
a mistyped address receives an unsolicited probe. Aim it at a radio you meant.

### `mark`
Drop a **sequenced timeline marker** into the log ring, then bracket a sequence
with `log tail since=<seq>` to capture exactly the events between two marks.

```json
→ {"cmd":"mark","value":"pre-tune"}
← {"ok":true,"seq":4992,"mono_us":34216461,"text":"pre-tune"}
```

Use the returned `seq` as the `since=` anchor for a later `log tail`.

### `log`
Runtime control of the Qt logging categories plus a ring-buffer tail and a live
push subscription — the observability suite. All diagnostic; nothing keys.

```json
→ {"cmd":"log","action":"categories"}
← {"ok":true,"categories":[{"id":"aether.connection","label":"Connection / Commands","enabled":true}, …]}

→ {"cmd":"log","action":"set","value":"aether.dsp on"}
← {"ok":true,"id":"aether.dsp","enabled":true}

→ {"cmd":"log","action":"tail","value":"50 since=4992"}
← {"ok":true,"events":[{"seq":5013,"t":"15:14:16.630","mono_us":34276567,"lvl":"D","cat":"aether.automation","msg":"…"}],
   "seq":5015,"oldest":12}
```

| `action` | `value` | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `categories` | — | list every category (`id`, `label`, `enabled`) |
| `get` | `<id>` | one category's enabled state |
| `set` | `<id> on\|off` (id `all` = every category) | toggle a category at runtime |
| `reset` | — | restore the operator's persisted category prefs |
| `tail` | `[n] [since=<seq>]` | newest `n` ring events, optionally only `seq > since` |
| `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` | — | start / stop a live push of new events on this connection |

`tail` also returns `oldest` (the oldest `seq` still resident): if your `since <
oldest`, earlier matching events were evicted and the window is a truncated
suffix, not a complete bracket.

In **Observe only** mode, `categories`, `get`, `tail`, `subscribe`, and
`unsubscribe` remain available. `set` and `reset` are blocked because they
change the app's logging state.

### `record`
Drive the client-side **QSO WAV recorder** (the same one behind the manual record
button), so a live test can capture audio and verify SSB + CW/CWX is recorded.
Not a transmit action — no gate.

```json
→ {"cmd":"record","action":"start"}
← {"ok":true,"record":"start","recording":true,"path":"/…/QSO_2026….wav"}

→ {"cmd":"record","action":"stop"}
← {"ok":true,"record":"stop","recording":false,"durationSecs":7,"path":"/…/QSO_2026….wav"}
```

`start` / `stop` / `status` (default) / `path` / `dir <path>` (set the output
directory).

**`start` can be refused** (#4629), and no file is created at all when it is.
Always check `ok` rather than assuming a start succeeded; a refusal carries a
machine-readable `reason` and a human `detail`, and reports `path` as empty.

`reason: "pc-audio-disabled"` — Client-Side recording captures the RX audio
stream that PC Audio creates, so with `PcAudioEnabled=False` there is nothing to
record:

```json
→ {"cmd":"record","action":"start"}
← {"ok":false,"record":"start","recording":false,"path":"",
   "reason":"pc-audio-disabled",
   "detail":"Client-Side recording requires PC Audio; no RX audio stream exists."}
```

`reason: "recording-mode-is-radio"` — `RecordingMode` is `Radio`, so the radio
is the recorder and this verb has nothing local to drive:

```json
← {"ok":false,"record":"start","recording":false,"path":"",
   "reason":"recording-mode-is-radio",
   "detail":"RecordingMode is Radio, so the radio records and no local file is written. Set RecordingMode=Client to drive the client-side recorder."}
```

This verb **refuses rather than redirecting**. It is documented as driving the
client-side recorder and returning the path of a local WAV, so silently issuing
`slice set <n> record=1` instead would be a radio state change from a call that
promised a local file — and a harness waiting for that file would get a success
it cannot use. Set `RecordingMode=Client` if you want a local recording.

### `station`
Set this GUI client's **MultiFlex station name** (FlexLib `SetClientStationName`)
so other clients on the radio see the agent driving. This is per-client and
session-scoped — it is **never** the radio-wide callsign (`radio callsign`), which
is persisted on the front panel.

```json
→ {"cmd":"station","value":"Claude"}
← {"ok":true,"station":"Claude"}
```

Must be a single token (no spaces) and requires a connected radio. The agent name
is applied automatically on connect and the user's real name is restored when the
bridge stops.

### `qrz`
QRZ.com callsign-lookup subsystem (CW decoder contact card + Tools → Callsign
Lookup). Four actions; none touch the radio and none key TX.

```json
→ {"cmd":"qrz","action":"status"}
← {"ok":true,"enabled":true,"hasCredentials":true,"cacheEntries":42,
   "hasOwnLocation":true}

→ {"cmd":"qrz","action":"cached","value":"KI6BCJ"}
← {"ok":true,"found":true,"entry":{"call":"KI6BCJ","nameFmt":"…","grid":"CM97",
   "stale":false,"photoPath":"/…/qrz-photos/KI6BCJ.jpg", …}}

→ {"cmd":"qrz","action":"lookup","value":"W1AW"}
← {"ok":true,"queued":true,"call":"W1AW","note":"async — poll `qrz cached W1AW`…"}

→ {"cmd":"qrz","action":"spottext","value":"CQ CQ DE KI6BCJ KI6BCJ K"}
← {"ok":true,"fed":"CQ CQ DE KI6BCJ KI6BCJ K"}
```

- `status` — enable flag, credential presence, lookup-cache entry count, and
  whether an own position (radio GPS/grid, or the operator's own QRZ record)
  is available for card distance/bearing.
- `cached <call>` — cache probe; returns the entry (plus `stale`, 7-day TTL,
  and `photoPath` when a photo is cached) or `found:false`. Never hits the
  network — safe to poll after `lookup`.
- `lookup <call>` — queue a real lookup through the service (cache-first;
  network only on miss/stale). Async: poll `qrz cached <call>` for arrival.
- `spottext <text>` — feed text into the **CW callsign spotter** as if the CW
  decoder produced it. Drives the real detection path ("DE <call> <call>" →
  service → contact card on the CW decode panel), so an agent can prove the

### `modem`

AetherModem demod profile and RX tap. Both verbs here construct the AetherModem
window **hidden** if it does not exist yet — the window hosts the KISS TNC, the
mailbox, and the terminal, so a headless soak box never has to open it.

```json
→ {"cmd":"modem","action":"profile","value":"hf300"}
← {"ok":true,
   "modem":{"profile":"300 baud HF","profileId":"Hf300","baud":300,
            "sampleRate":24000,"markHz":1600,"spaceHz":1800,"lanes":21,
            "enabled":true,"description":"300 baud HF: 24000 Hz, 300 bps, ..."},
   "demod":{"rmsDbfs":-21.5,"peakDbfs":-10.1,"clippedPercent":0.0,
            "markMinusSpaceDb":1.2,"receiveGateOpen":true,
            "hdlcFrameCandidates":31,"plausibleAx25Candidates":22,
            "framesAccepted":18,"rejectBadFcs":4,"rejectTooShort":9,
            "rejectMalformed":0}}
```

- **`modem status`** (or bare `modem`) — the block above, read-only.
- **`modem profile hf300|vhf1200`** — switches the demod profile by *clicking
  the profile radio button*, so the choice persists and the connected-mode link
  timing is re-derived exactly as it is for a human. Aliases `hf`/`300` and
  `vhf`/`1200` are accepted.
- **`modem on` / `modem off`** — start/stop the RX tap. The verb **verifies** the
  checkbox actually took and returns `ok:false` if the modem refused (no audio
  engine, no attached slice) rather than reporting success for work that did not
  happen.
- **`modem digi`** / **`modem digi status`** — WIDE1-1 fill-in digipeater
  snapshot (`enabled`, call, alias, dupe window, beacon fields, heard/repeated
  counters, and the **current air rate** `baud` / `profileId`). The fill-in
  engine is baud-agnostic; 300 Hz HF and 1200 Hz VHF share one modem profile
  (`modem profile hf300|vhf1200`). Read-only.
- **`modem digi on` / `modem digi off`** — arm/disarm the fill-in. `on` ⚠️
  keys the transmitter whenever a matching UI frame is heard, so it is refused
  unless `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1`. Verifies the checkbox actually took
  (a missing digi callsign or a profile other than 1200 baud fails closed).
  Fill-in starts disarmed on every launch; configuration and beacon preference
  persist, but TX authorization does not. Disabling fill-in cancels its pending
  repeats/beacons and active TX without discarding other producers' packets.
  Disabling the modem, changing the attached slice, disconnecting the radio,
  or switching to 300 baud also disarms fill-in. Both Digi enable checkboxes
  are TX-keying controls for generic automation invocations.
- **`modem digi beacon`** ⚠️ — fire one fill-in-style position beacon now
  (same `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1` rail). Fails if there is no callsign or
  no GPS/manual position.

```json
→ {"cmd":"modem","action":"digi","value":"status"}
← {"ok":true,"baud":1200,"profileId":"Vhf1200",
   "digi":{"enabled":true,"call":"KI6BCJ-7","alias":"WIDE1-1",
           "alsoMyCall":true,"alsoRelay":false,"dupeWindowSecs":30,
           "beaconEnabled":false,"beaconIntervalMin":15,
           "heard":12,"repeated":3,"droppedDupe":1,"droppedNoMatch":8,
           "droppedOwn":0,"baud":1200,"profileId":"Vhf1200"}}
```

The `demod` block is what separates "no frames because the band is dead" from
"no frames because the audio tap never started": `receiveGateOpen` plus a
non-`-120` `rmsDbfs` means audio is arriving, and `rejectBadFcs` climbing while
`framesAccepted` does not means the decoder is finding structure and losing it
to bit errors.

### `civ`

Icom CI-V and RS-BA1 session diagnostics. The read-only actions work in an
observe-only bridge; raw injection remains TX-gated because arbitrary CI-V can
key or retune the radio.

**`civ session`** reports the media lease and each independent UDP stream:

```json
→ {"cmd":"civ","action":"session"}
← {"ok":true,"civ":"session","result":{
   "authenticated":true,"connected":true,"streamGranted":true,
   "lastRenewalResult":"accepted","lastRenewalResponse":"0x00000000",
   "lastRenewalSequence":42,"nextInnerSequence":43,
   "tokenRequestId":"0x8f31",
   "lastAcceptedAgeMs":8123,"pendingRenewals":0,
   "acceptedRenewals":14,"reissuedTokens":1,"rejectedRenewals":0,
   "ignoredAuthReplies":0,"ignoredControlPackets":1,
   "initialMaintenanceMs":30000,"initialMaintenancePending":false,
   "renewalCadenceMs":60000,"ackGraceMs":3000,"deadSessionMs":80000,
   "transport":{
     "control":{"rxPackets":921,"txPackets":460,"rttMs":21,
                "lastRxAgeMs":14,"lastPayloadAgeMs":8123,"socketErrors":0},
     "serial":{"rxPackets":4821,"txPackets":3370,"rttMs":24,
               "lastRxAgeMs":11,"lastPayloadAgeMs":11,"socketErrors":0},
     "audio":{"rxPackets":186402,"txPackets":92160,"rttMs":26,
              "lastRxAgeMs":3,"lastPayloadAgeMs":3,"socketErrors":0}}}}
```

Use this first when the panadapter, CI-V controls, and audio stop together. A
healthy result has a recent accepted token, response `0x00000000`, no growing
pending/rejected count, recent activity on all three streams, and no growing
socket-error count. A live control stream beside a stale serial
`lastPayloadAgeMs` isolates the CI-V data pipe from authentication and broad
network loss. The health verb shows the lease essentials under **RS-BA1
session**.

The token-request ID is freshly randomized for each login. On an immediate
reconnect the radio can answer the initial token request with `0xffffffff` and
a token that must be used to request the streams; wfview follows the same path.
`lastRenewalResult:"reissued"` distinguishes that valid reconnect exchange
from the same nonzero response rejecting an established lease renewal.

The first maintenance renewal is sent at 30 seconds because a live immediate
reconnect grant stopped its media streams around 45 seconds even though the
ordinary 60-second renewal was later accepted. After that one early renewal,
the session returns to the wfview/kappanhang 60-second cadence.

**`civ scheduler`** reports the shared command-plane scheduler rather than one
producer in isolation:

```json
→ {"cmd":"civ","action":"scheduler"}
← {"ok":true,"civ":"scheduler","result":{
   "idle":false,"slotMs":25,"readTimeoutMs":350,
   "queueDepth":3,"readInFlight":true,"inFlightKey":"meter.s",
   "queued":812,"dispatched":799,"coalesced":96,
   "replies":796,"staleReplies":1,"lateReplies":1,"unmatchedFrames":3,
   "timeouts":2,"responseSamples":797,"lastResponseMs":42,
   "averageResponseMs":38.7,"maxResponseMs":361,
   "lastResponseAgeMs":18,"lastCompletedKey":"meter.s",
   "lastTimeoutKey":"control.nr",
   "pendingPttIntent":false}}
```

The scheduler also returns up to 128 `transactions`, `firstRetainedEventId`,
`lastRetainedEventId`, and `stateFreshness` (see Persist above). `civ scheduler
freshness` returns the same reply with an empty `transactions` list — and with
`firstRetainedEventId`/`lastRetainedEventId` describing **the rows actually
returned**, so a truncated reply never advertises coverage of events it omitted
(both are **0 when `transactions` is empty**, meaning "this reply describes no
events" — not a backward jump, and never something to compare against a
previously collected ID) — for callers that only need the confirmation block — the TX harness polls it that way on its
unkey path rather than pulling the whole ring to read one field. Deduplicate
completion events by `backendInstanceId` plus `eventId`, never by semantic
`key`/`generation`/`completion`: periodic polls reuse those three fields.
Event IDs increase across ring eviction, history clears and scheduler resets.
A timeout and its eventual late reply are separate completion events. A jump
past the previously collected ID is an evidence gap, not zero missing activity.
A new backend starts a new UUID `backendInstanceId`, also present inside
`stateFreshness`; use it even when a reconnect reuses the same process and radio.

While a PTT request is awaiting confirmation the reply also carries
`"pttIntent"` (the requested state) and `"pttIntentRemainingMs"` (how much of
the bounded window is left). Suppression applies only while `pttIntent` is
`true`: a radio reporting TX after an unkey request is always published, never
held back. See the Icom CI-V backend design doc for why the two directions are
not symmetric.

Use it when controls feel delayed or meters stop. A bounded queue with replies
advancing is healthy. A growing queue plus timeouts identifies CI-V command-
plane loss even if RS-BA1 link counters and the panadapter still move.
`staleReplies` is expected to remain near zero; it proves an old poll was
discarded after a newer operator intent instead of rolling the UI backward.
A few per session are normal — one per operator write that overtook a poll
already on the wire. It climbing *with* `timeouts`, or tracking the rate the
operator moves controls, means replies are routinely arriving after their
transaction expired: read it alongside `queueDepth` and treat the pair, not
`staleReplies` alone, as the congestion signal. Poll this read-only verb until
`idle:true` when a test needs deterministic write/readback convergence.

**`civ incident`** returns the last structured Icom incident captured during
the current session, or a live snapshot if no incident has occurred. The same
snapshot is written automatically as one `aether.icom.incident` warning when:

- a key-on transaction times out, or the radio still reports unkeyed after its
  confirmation window;
- a CI-V timeout occurs with at least eight transactions queued;
- no CI-V frame arrives for five seconds while the UDP transport remains up;
- an established RS-BA1 session closes unexpectedly.

The dossier joins the evidence needed to locate the failed layer: correlated
lease renewal state, independent control/serial/audio packet activity and
socket errors, scheduler latency aggregates, the last 32 payload-free
transaction outcomes, and requested versus radio-published PTT. It deliberately
contains no credentials, network endpoints, session IDs, raw CI-V payloads,
frequencies, or operator text. This means ordinary support logs can retain it;
turning on every-frame CI-V or RS-BA1 datagram logging is not required for the
first reproduction.

Each transaction row reports a semantic `key`, `priority`, `completion`,
`queueWaitMs`, and `responseMs`. Completions distinguish normal, stale, late,
late-stale, timed-out, emergency-displaced, and response-free commands. Use the
per-stream ages to separate socket/transport silence from a live RS-BA1 outer
session whose CI-V payload pipe alone stopped responding.

**`civ trace [all]`** reads the bounded decoded CI-V frame trace. The default
omits routine meter traffic; `all` includes it. **`civ send <hex>`** injects
command bytes through the active Icom session and is reserved for controlled
hardware tests. Raw RS-BA1 datagram logging is intentionally off by default and
should only be enabled briefly when these structured diagnostics are
insufficient.

The `icom.profile.show` extension distinguishes `modelId` (the `19 00` payload)
from `civAddress` (the current command destination). A custom address can differ
from the model ID; Network Radio Name does not select either value.

**`civ wake <model-id-hex> <address-hex>`** explicitly requests one wake and one
bounded reconnect on the current Icom network session. Supported selections are
IC-705 (`civ wake a4 a4`), IC-7300MK2 (`civ wake b6 b6`), and IC-9700
(`civ wake a2 a2`); the second argument may instead be its custom radio address. The model selection authorizes framing only; CI-V still
establishes identity and capabilities after reconnect. The response acknowledges
the request, not radio readiness. No power-off command is exposed. Read-only
mode refuses this action. Disconnect or another connection selection cancels it.

The connection panel's **Wake Icom on connect** checkbox persists in the `Icom`
settings document (`wakeOnConnect`, default false). It requests wake only after
identity discovery exhausts. Auto uses the CI-V destination advertised by the
RS-BA1 radio, independently of its editable network name. A custom destination
is respected. An unidentified custom address requires an explicit model in
Connect by IP or `civ wake`; otherwise wake refuses with guidance instead of
guessing standard framing for an IC-9700. Supported factory destinations from
the network record may select a framing hint. Model identity and transmit
capabilities still come only from the subsequent `19 00` reply.
Connection advice/progress uses the connection panel while it is open;
mid-session advice uses the status bar. Temporary messages keep the existing
Connect control visible and restore its normal position when the message clears.
The post-wake reconnect disables another wake and expires after 20 seconds;
IC-705 and IC-7300MK2 reconnect after one second and probe identity each second
until it arrives; IC-9700 retains its measured ten-second pre-reconnect delay. Radio configuration
settings are not modified. IC-705 and IC-7300MK2 use their documented `18 01`
command with standard framing; IC-9700 retains its measured extra FE prefix and
E1 controller. Live network wake for the first two still requires hardware
validation. Network control must remain reachable: an offline Wi-Fi interface
cannot receive a wake command.

### `controls`

The CI-V control and meter registry, joined against what is actually wired.
**Icom only** — other families answer "no control registry".

This exists because a half-wired control is indistinguishable from a working one
by inspection. The RF-gain slider drove the *preamp* for weeks; three filter
buttons reached one filter in AM and one in CW; the ADC-overflow meter was
polled, answered, and silently dropped every reply. Each was found by an operator
noticing a wrong number, one control at a time. This verb answers for all of them
at once.

**`controls map`** — every CI-V message the backend names, with its wire address,
raw and seam ranges, the seam verb it maps to, the UI control that drives it, and
what it has actually done this session. Read-only; works with no radio attached.
For Icom, `supported`, `profileFeature`, `profileEvidence`, and `profileSource`
describe the effective active-model row; an unsupported row is declaration
inventory, not a claim that the radio accepts it. Core controls and scope on a
scope-capable discovered model can be reachable with `profileEvidence: "none"`:
the former is the backend's model-neutral CI-V floor and the latter matches the
identity geometry already used by scope startup. Evidence remains independent
so neither is presented as guide- or live-attested.

```json
→ {"cmd":"controls","args":"map"}
← {"ok":true,"controls":"map","result":[
   {"id":"_diagnostics","framesObserved":591,"controlsSeen":26,"controlsSent":2},
   {"id":"rf.gain","civ":"14 02","plane":"pan","encoding":"level255",
    "wiring":"both","rawRange":"0..255","neutralRange":"0..100 %",
    "seamVerb":"setPanRfGain","uiTarget":"panRfGainSlider","readAtConnect":true,
    "sentThisSession":true,"seenThisSession":true,"gap":"",
    "note":"PERCENT, not dB — the register has no published decibel mapping."},
   {"id":"af.gain","civ":"14 01","wiring":"decode-only","seamVerb":"",
    "uiTarget":"sliceAudioGainSlider",
    "gap":"readable but not settable — no seam verb reaches this register"}]}
```

`wiring` is the declared state — `both`, `send-only`, `decode-only` or
`declared-only` (a constant with no call sites at all). `gap` names the problem
in words when there is one, so a caller can sort by it. `sentThisSession` and
`seenThisSession` are *observed*, not declared: a row claiming `both` that has
never been seen after a full connect is the interesting case. The
`_diagnostics` row separates "the radio is silent" from "the registry matches
nothing" — without it an all-false `seen` column is ambiguous.

**`controls meters`** — the 0x15 meter registry with each meter's scale, poll
interval, and **how long ago it last produced a reading**.

```json
→ {"cmd":"controls","args":"meters"}
← {"ok":true,"result":[
   {"id":"SLC:LEVEL","civ":"15 02","unit":"dBm","range":"-140..-10",
    "pollMs":100,"when":"rx-only","visible":true,"ageMs":142,"status":"LIVE"},
   {"id":"RAD:OVF","civ":"15 07","unit":"Percent","range":"0..1",
    "pollMs":500,"when":"rx-only","visible":true,"ageMs":-1,
    "status":"NEVER FED — defined and no reading has ever arrived"}]}
```

Age is the point. A meter that is defined and never fed renders as a real
instrument reading a quiet band, which is worse than a missing one; a definition
alone proves nothing. `IDLE` distinguishes a transmit-only meter that is
correctly quiet while receiving from one that is broken.

**`controls scrub [id|plane]`** — the linkage check. Drives every settable
control through its seam verb **at its current value**, then verifies that the
exact frame reached either the wire or the CI-V scheduler. Nothing on the radio
moves. Because dispatch is asynchronous, finish a scrub by polling
`civ scheduler` until `idle:true`; no increase in `timeouts` proves every
admitted command completed its dispatch/readback transaction.

```json
→ {"cmd":"controls","args":"scrub"}
← {"ok":true,"result":{"checked":25,"linked":17,"broken":0,"notTested":8,
   "rows":[{"id":"rf.gain","civ":"14 02","seamVerb":"setPanRfGain",
            "reachedWire":false,"reachedScheduler":true,"status":"LINKED",
            "verdict":"the seam verb admitted this exact command to the CI-V
                       scheduler; wait for `civ scheduler` idle with no new
                       timeout to prove dispatch and readback"},
           {"id":"rit.offset","civ":"21 00","status":"NOT-TESTED",
            "verdict":"no safe way to re-assert this without changing the
                       operator's setting — not a fault, not a pass"}]}}
```

Three outcomes, not two. `NOT-TESTED` is a real state — a control the scrub
could not drive without changing the operator's setting — and collapsing it into
either pass or fail would misreport it.

`reachedWire` and `reachedScheduler` are deliberately separate. An idle
scheduler with unchanged timeout count promotes the latter from accepted work
to completed wire/readback proof without making the synchronous scrub block the
application event loop.

The scrub clears the enable-dedupe sentinels first: NR, NB and both notches
suppress an enable that matches what was last sent, which is correct in normal
use and would otherwise swallow exactly the frame being tested. It re-sends the
same value, so the radio still does not move.

**PTT, the antenna tuner and power-off are never scrubbed.** Two of them transmit
and the third powers the radio off over a link that cannot power it back on.

### `link`

Connected-mode AX.25: the terminal (calling side) and the Personal Mailbox
System (answering side). One `link status` returns **both** sides, each with the
full data-link snapshot.

```json
→ {"cmd":"link","action":"status"}
← {"ok":true,
   "terminal":{"myCall":"KI6BCJ-7","mode":"command","connected":false,
               "connecting":false,"peer":"","summary":"Disconnected — KI6BCJ-7 ready",

> ⚠️ **`link connect`, `link disconnect` and `link pms on` key the transmitter**

- **`link status`** (or bare `link`) — the block above, read-only.
- **`link mycall <call>`** — set the terminal callsign (persisted).
- **`link connect <call> [via <digi>[,<digi>]]`** ⚠️ — dial a BBS. Routed through
  the terminal's own `CONNECT` parser, so VIA paths and callsign validation
  behave identically to a typed command. Returns `ok:false` if MYCALL is unset,
  a session is already up, or the parser rejected the callsign.
- **`link disconnect`** ⚠️ — graceful DISC. Twice in a row is a hard drop that
  transmits nothing, which is the escape hatch when a DISC retry storm is
  keying for its full N2 budget.
- **`link listen <call>` / `link alias <call>`** — the mailbox's listen and
  vanity callsigns (persisted). The mailbox cannot be enabled without a valid
  listen callsign.
- **`link pms on`** ⚠️ **`| off`** — start/stop the mailbox. `on` is gated: a
  listening mailbox answers callers and beacons on its own, which is
  transmitting without a human in the loop. Like `modem on`, this **verifies**
  the state took: a mailbox with no listen callsign silently unchecks itself,
  and the verb reports that as an error naming the fix.

**`t1TooShort` is the headline field.** It is true once the link has measured
round trips at or beyond its own T1 — meaning the timer expires before the ack
can physically arrive, and no channel improvement will help. It is the same
verdict the `aether.ax25.link` log marks as `T1_TOO_SHORT`, exposed so a bridge
test can assert on it directly instead of scraping the log. `modelRttMs` is what
the airtime model predicts for the current profile and paclen; comparing it with
`rtt.avgMs` is how you tell whether the model matches the air. See
[`HFMODEM.md`](HFMODEM.md).

Bare-line forms: `modem profile hf300`, `modem on`, `modem digi status`,
`modem digi on`, `modem digi beacon`, `link status`,
`link mycall KI6BCJ-7`, `link connect N0BBS-1 via WIDE1-1`, `link pms on`.

---

## Transmit verbs ⚠️ (gated)

These verbs **key the live transmitter** and are refused unless the app was
launched with `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1` (the same rail as a keying `invoke`).
A force-unkey watchdog (`AETHER_AUTOMATION_TX_MAX_MS`, default 20 s) drops an
automation-originated continuous key that runs too long, and the bridge
force-unkeys its own active TX lease on stop. Merely enabling TX permission
does not apply this timeout to operator, DAX, or TCI transmissions. The lease
covers the key-up an accepted action causes directly (allowing ~2 s for a
deferred click); a bridge action that only *arms* a long-fuse feature — the
WSPR beacon waits for the next even UTC minute, then keys for 111.6 s — is not
claimed, so that transmission runs to completion under the feature's own
timers rather than being cut at `TX_MAX_MS`. **Verify the
TX antenna is your dummy load before keying** (`get slice tx txAntenna`, or set
it with `slice txant ANT2`). Unkey/stop sub-actions are always allowed.

### `key`
PTT / MOX keying via `RadioModel::setTransmit` — the exact path the space-bar PTT
filter and the `mox_toggle` shortcut take, which `invoke` can't reach.

```json
→ {"cmd":"key","action":"ptt","value":"on"}    # gated
← {"ok":true,"key":"ptt","state":"on"}

→ {"cmd":"key","action":"ptt","value":"off"}   # always allowed
← {"ok":true,"key":"ptt","state":"off"}
```

`key ptt on|off` keys/unkeys (also `press`/`release`, `1`/`0`). `key mox` is a
**toggle**: keyed → unkeys (allowed), idle → keys (gated). Keying arms the
force-unkey watchdog.

### `cwx`
Drive the CWX CW keyer — the easy repro for post-TX FFT-floor recovery (#3804).

```json
→ {"cmd":"cwx","action":"send","value":"CQ TEST DE W1AW"}   # gated
← {"ok":true,"cwx":"send","chars":15}
```

| `action` | `value` | gated? | effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `send` | `<text>` | **yes** | key CW for the string (arms the watchdog) |
| `speed` (alias `wpm`) | `<5–100>` | no | set keyer speed |
| `stop` (alias `abort`/`clear`) | — | no | abort the keying buffer |

Stage the slice into a CW mode first (`invoke sliceModeCombo setCurrentText CW`)
for the radio to actually emit.

Every action here emits a `cwx` verb at the radio, so on a connected backend that
declares `hasRadioSideCwKeyer=false` (an HL2, the demo) all three return an error
rather than `ok:true` for work the radio would silently drop:

```json
→ {"cmd":"cwx","action":"send","value":"CQ"}
← {"ok":false,"error":"cwx unavailable: this radio has no radio-side CW keyer (no `cwx` command plane)"}
```

Disconnected it still answers, like every other capability gate here — with
nothing attached there is nothing to be honest about.

### `txtest`
Two-tone TX test signal (for IMD / PA / meter measurements).

On Icom, this path uses **Tune Power**, not RF Power. Stage and verify Tune
Power before `twotone`; neither its percentage nor
`AETHER_AUTOMATION_TX_MAX_POWER` is a watt guarantee. Use the measured-watt and
antenna gates in [`TX_TEST_PROMPT.md`](automation/TX_TEST_PROMPT.md).

```json
→ {"cmd":"txtest","action":"twotone"}   # gated
← {"ok":true,"txtest":"twotone"}

→ {"cmd":"txtest","action":"off"}        # always allowed (alias stop)
← {"ok":true,"txtest":"off"}
```

### `transmit`
Set the transmit drive — `rfpower` (RF Power) or `tunepower` (Tune Power), 0..100.
TX-gated like `key`, and the gate is reported **before** the value is validated so
it cannot be probed with nonsense.

The value is additionally **clamped to `AETHER_AUTOMATION_TX_MAX_POWER`**. That
ceiling is enforced elsewhere in `invoke()`'s widget path, keyed on the control's
accessible name, so a verb reaching `TransmitModel` directly would otherwise inherit
no bound at all — on the surface most likely to be feeding a transverter or an
amplifier. When a request is clamped the reply says so rather than quietly honouring
a different number than was asked for.

```json
→ {"cmd":"transmit","action":"rfpower","value":"25"}   # gated
← {"ok":true,"transmit":"rfpower","rfPower":25,"tunePower":10}

→ {"cmd":"transmit","action":"rfpower","value":"90"}   # ceiling of 30 in force
← {"ok":true,"transmit":"rfpower","rfPower":30,"tunePower":10,"requested":90,"clampedTo":30}
```

### `atu`
Antenna-tuner control. `bypass` is relay-only (takes the tuner out of circuit so
meters see the raw load) and does **not** transmit; `start` runs a tune cycle that
**keys TX**.

```json
→ {"cmd":"atu","action":"bypass"}   # no TX, always allowed
← {"ok":true,"atu":"bypass"}

→ {"cmd":"atu","action":"start"}     # gated (alias tune)
← {"ok":true,"atu":"start"}
```

### `testtone`
Inject a **client-side test tone** into the TX mic/audio path (frequency Hz +
level dB). It does not key by itself — it only reaches the air if you also key
(which is gated) — so the verb itself is ungated, but it stages a TX signal and
belongs with the transmit group.

```json
→ {"cmd":"testtone","action":"on","value":"1000 -10"}
← {"ok":true,"testtone":"on","freqHz":1000,"levelDb":-10}

→ {"cmd":"testtone","action":"off"}
← {"ok":true,"testtone":"off"}
```

### Errors
Every failure is a one-line object: `{"ok":false,"error":"<message>"}` — e.g.
`widget not found: Foo`, `blocked: '…' looks transmit-related …`,
`no slice for selector 'tx'`, `no local radios have been discovered`,
`timed out waiting for radio connection`, `unknown action: x`,
`unknown command: x`.

## Targeting a widget

`grab` and `invoke` resolve a `target` string in this order. Within each match
class, visible/enabled widgets win over hidden duplicate controls; hidden
widgets are only a fallback when there is no visible candidate, and `invoke`
will refuse to drive a hidden widget.

0. **VFO shortcuts** — `"vfo slice 1"` or `"vfo:slice:1"` targets the VFO
   flag for slice 1. `"vfo 1"` or `"vfo:1"` targets the first VFO flag inside
   the `SpectrumWidget` whose `panIndex` is 1, mirroring `grab pan 1`.
   Prefer the slice form when a pan contains multiple VFOs.
1. **Pan-scoped `"pan <index>/<name>"`** — targets a control inside the
   `PanadapterApplet` whose `SpectrumWidget` has that `panIndex`, e.g.
   `"pan 0/Display"` or `"pan 0/displayAutoBlackBtn"`. This is the preferred
   form when multiple panadapters have the same side buttons or Display panel
   object names.
2. **Scoped `"<scope>/<name>"`** — disambiguates a control whose
   `accessibleName` appears in more than one applet (e.g. `"AF gain"` and
   `"Squelch threshold"` exist in **both** `RxApplet` and `PanadapterApplet`).
   `<scope>` matches an ancestor by objectName, class, or accessibleName;
   `<name>` is resolved within that subtree by objectName, class,
   accessibleName, then button text. Use `"RxApplet/AF gain"` vs
   `"PanadapterApplet/AF gain"`, or target an objectName such as
   `"PanadapterApplet/displayAutoBlackBtn"`. Falls through to flat matching if
   it doesn't resolve, so a literal `/` in a name still works.
3. **Exact `objectName`** — the most stable handle. Prefer this.
4. **Class name** — full (`AetherSDR::SpectrumWidget`) or short
   (`SpectrumWidget`). Handy when a widget has no objectName (the panadapter is
   targeted as `SpectrumWidget`).
5. **`accessibleName`** — e.g. `"Panadapter spectrum display"`,
   `"Master volume"`.
6. **Button text** — last resort, e.g. `"Send"`, `"Transmit"`. Lowest priority,
   so a real objectName/accessibleName always wins; first match in tree order.
7. **Visible popup-menu action** — exact `QAction` objectName, visible text,
   tooltip, status tip, or data value. Use `invoke <label-or-data> trigger` to
   choose a menu item.

To find a target: run `dumpTree`, search the JSON for the `accessibleName` or
`class` you want, and use its `objectName` if it has one. Roughly half of
`src/gui/` is annotated with `setObjectName`/`setAccessibleName`; finishing that
backlog (see [`docs/a11y.md`](a11y.md), enforced by
[`tools/check_a11y.py`](../tools/check_a11y.py)) directly improves what you can
target here.

---

## Recipes

**Assert on state (no pixels) — the default.**
```python
tree = bridge.request({"cmd": "dumpTree"})
node = find(tree["roots"], accessibleName="Master volume")
assert node["value"] == "42" and node["enabled"]
```

**Capture for a genuinely-visual check.**
```python
r = bridge.request({"cmd": "grab", "target": "SpectrumWidget", "path": "/tmp/pan.png"})
assert r["ok"] and r["width"] > 0
# then view /tmp/pan.png, or perceptual-diff it against a golden (Phase 3)
```

**Drive a control and confirm the model followed.**
```python
bridge.request({"cmd": "invoke", "target": "sliceModeCombo", "action": "setCurrentText", "value": "USB"})
assert bridge.request({"cmd": "get", "model": "slice", "selector": "active", "property": "mode"})["value"] == "USB"
```

**Snapshot → act → assert** (the loop you already use for web work): snapshot
with `dumpTree`/`get`, drive the change with `invoke`, then `get` (or another
`dumpTree`) and assert the `value`/model field changed. Keep transmit out of the
loop — the guard blocks it, and so should your scenarios.

Prefer **structural** assertions (`dumpTree` values) over screenshots wherever
possible — they're exact, fast, and identical across OSes. Reserve `grab` +
image comparison for assertions that are *inherently* visual (did the waterfall
actually paint? is the layout right?), because a live spectrum is
non-deterministic noise and won't golden-match until replay mode (Phase 2)
lands.

### Workspace pan-layout proof

`workspace pan-layout <id>` drives the same production path as selecting a
panadapter layout in the UI. It persists `PanadapterLayout`, creates or removes
pans to reach the layout's count, and reflows Workspace Canvas pan rectangles
when canvas mode is enabled. Valid IDs are `1`, `2v`, `2h`, `2h1`, `12h`,
`3v`, `2x2`, `4v`, `3h2`, `2x3`, `4h3`, and `2x4`.

Pan creation and removal settle asynchronously. The initial reply includes
`targetPanCount`, active-main `panCount`, global `globalPanCount`, and
`settling`. Poll `workspace status` until the active main surface has the
target pan count before asserting its live rectangles. Floating pans and pans
on extra surfaces are outside that count and remain untouched. To prove the
rectangles persisted, disable and re-enable canvas mode (or restart with the
same isolated settings profile) and assert the replayed geometry. This action
returns an error before mutation when the target cannot fit within the radio's
receiver capacity. It never enables transmit and remains available without
`AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX`.

---

## Gotchas

- **Off by default.** No `AETHER_AUTOMATION` → no server, zero overhead, no
  socket. This is intentional; never enable it in a shipped build.
- **`invoke` can't key the radio.** Transmit controls are refused unless
  `AETHER_AUTOMATION_ALLOW_TX=1` — see [TX safety](#tx-safety). Don't disable the
  guard just to get a test green.
- **`get` needs a model.** It reads the active-session `RadioModel`; fields are
  empty/zero until a radio connects. Run it once connected, or assert on
  `connected` first.
- **GPU panadapter capture.** `SpectrumWidget` is a `QRhiWidget` when built with
  `AETHER_GPU_SPECTRUM` (the default). The bridge uses
  `QRhiWidget::grabFramebuffer()` for raw `SpectrumWidget`/`grab pan` captures
  because plain `QWidget::grab()` returns an empty surface for a GPU widget.
  For screenshots that must include child overlays such as VFO flags, use
  `grab pan-visible <index>`.
- **Live spectrum isn't golden-able.** Pixels off a live radio are noise.
  Deterministic visual diffs need the recorded-fixture replay mode (Phase 2).
- **Stale socket after a crash.** On a hard kill the C++ destructor may not run,
  leaving the socket + discovery file behind. This self-heals: the next launch
  clears the stale socket (`removeServer`) and rewrites the discovery file.
- **Geometry is global.** `geometry` is in screen coordinates (via
  `mapToGlobal`), so it correlates with computer-use/screenshots if you ever
  cross-check.

## Roadmap (issue #3646)

| Phase | Adds | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `dumpTree` + `grab` over `QLocalServer` behind `AETHER_AUTOMATION` | **done** |
| 1 | `invoke <target> <action>` (TX-guarded) + `get radio\|slice\|pan` model snapshots | **done** |
| 2 | Replay/fixture mode (recorded VITA-49 FFT + meters) → deterministic panadapter without hardware | planned |
| 3 | CI E2E matrix: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` + agent scenarios + per-OS perceptual golden diffs | planned |
| 4 | Computer-use / VNC kept as the *exploratory* tier (real GPU/WM smoke), not the regression backbone | planned |

## Verb registry (auto-generated)

The complete registry, generated from the `add(...)` table in `AutomationServer.cpp` by `tools/gen_bridge_docs.py`. CI fails if this drifts from the code.

### ANAN droop calibration

`droopcal status|start|stop|apply|discard` requires a connected ANAN backend
with `hostDroopCalibration`. Other families refuse the request before any
backend call. `start` measures the receiver noise floor across ANAN's six
DDC0 rates; use an antenna termination as described in Radio Setup → Droop
Correction. `stop` keeps the partial result, `apply` installs and saves it,
and `discard` drops the staged measurements.

The calibrator is owned by `AnanBackend`, not shared `RadioModel`. The dialog
and bridge use `invokeExtension("anan", "droop.<action>")`; synchronous replies
carry `running`, `rateIndex`, `totalRates`, `hasResult`, `percent`, `message`,
and `corrections` (per-rate `rateKsps`, `minDb`, `maxDb`). Progress uses
`extensionStatus("anan", "droop", fields)` with the same fields. Disconnect
stops the sweep without issuing a restoration rate change. No calibration
code changes RX audio or keys TX. Physical-radio persistence validation is
still a separate radiocert task.

## Suggested verbs

Gaps found while proving a feature against real hardware, kept here so the next
person hits a note instead of the wall.

### `memory save|list|remove`

`memory` can only `activate`. Everything else about a memory channel has to be
driven through the GUI: quick-save is a modal dialog whose QLineEdit has no
`objectName` (it is reachable only via the scoped `QDialog/QLineEdit` form), and
the Memory dialog's **Import…/Export… open NATIVE file dialogs, which the bridge
cannot drive at all**. So the CSV round trip — the thing most likely to regress,
because it is a chained `create`→`set` per record — has no automated proof at
the GUI level today.

Proposed:

| Verb | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `memory save <name>` | Save the active slice as a memory; returns the new index. Covers `createMemoryFromSlice()` without the modal. |
| `memory list` | Dump the memory cache as JSON — lets a test assert on channels without screenshotting a table. |
| `memory remove <index>` | Delete a slot; makes tests self-cleaning instead of leaving channels in the operator's bank. |
| `memory import <path>` / `memory export <path>` | Take a path directly, bypassing the native file dialog. The only way to get the CSV flows under automation. |

All four are RX/config, no TX gate. `memory list` in particular would have
replaced several screenshots in this feature's verification.

### Persist observation and FFT provenance limits

Applet scenario and per-control outcomes combine model samples and widget samples.
Every widget sample is retained: a later matching value cannot conceal an earlier
mismatch. A failed or unobserved seed presentation makes later retention
inconclusive even after convergence. Hidden, disabled, ambiguous, missing, and
unselected EQ controls remain presentation gaps; observation never selects a page
to repair them. The Markdown report uses these combined outcomes.

The FFT no-echo repair covers Average and FPS only. Weighted averaging and
waterfall rate still follow their existing radio-publication paths; this change
does not establish whether their setters echo on every firmware version.
The aetherd panadapter resource exposes the same Average/FPS request provenance
and last radio publications as the bridge, including same-value confirmations.
