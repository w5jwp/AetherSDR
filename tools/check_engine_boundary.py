AetherSDR engine-boundary static checker (aetherd migration ratchet).

Guards the dependency direction the aetherd RFC
(docs/aetherd-headless-engine-design.md) is built on:

  EB1  No file under src/core/ or src/models/ may include a src/gui/
       header. One legacy offender exists (AutomationServer.cpp →
       ConnectionPanel.h) and is tracked for seam-extraction in RFC
       step 1; any OTHER occurrence is an error.

  EB2  No file under src/core/ or src/models/ may include a QtWidgets
       class header. Five legacy offenders are known and tracked for
       relocation during RFC step 1 (KNOWN_WIDGETS_LEGACY below); they
       warn as "known". Any OTHER file warns as NEW leakage.

  EB3  No file ABOVE the radio seam may include a VENDOR header —
       family-specific wire code kept *behind* IRadioBackend. "Above the
       seam" is everything in src/gui/, src/core/, and src/models/ plus
       app-shell files at the src/ root, EXCEPT the backend tree
       (src/core/backends/) and the vendor translation units themselves.
       Today's coupling is frozen as a per-file
       baseline of the EXACT vendor headers each file may include
       (KNOWN_VENDOR_INCLUDE_BASELINE). A file may only SHRINK its set;
       any header not in its baseline row — a brand-new include, OR a
       lateral swap that keeps the count flat (drop RadioConnection, add
       KiwiSdrManager) — fails --strict. A set, not a count, so churn
       that trades one vendor dependency for another can't slip through.
       This is RFC step 2.4's ratchet: the interface already exists, so
       no new code should reach around it — existing includers are
       decoupled subsystem-by-subsystem (each routed through the seam)
       and their rows driven to empty. Relocation does not convert a
       touchpoint: the five Flex wire classes now live under
       src/core/backends/flex/ (#5554 §2.6 slice 1) and their callers
       use those explicit paths, still tracked by EB3. Matching is by
       header STEM, so a move changes no baseline row. The vendor vocabulary is derived at runtime
       from the touchpoint audit (docs/architecture/
       aetherd-touchpoint-tags.json) so the audit is the single source
       of truth — a header newly tagged vendor there is enforced without
       editing this file. See docs/agents/backends.md ("Engine boundary ratchet — EB3").

Exit 0 always in default mode (annotation/warning stage, like
check_a11y.py). --strict exits 1 on any non-legacy EB1/EB2/EB3 finding
— new leakage blocks immediately while the tracked baselines shrink to
zero during the migration. Shrink the legacy lists; never grow them.

Usage:
    python tools/check_engine_boundary.py [file1 file2 ...]
    python tools/check_engine_boundary.py            # scan all engine files
    python tools/check_engine_boundary.py --strict

stdlib only; no third-party dependencies.

# The audit is the source of truth for what IS vendor; this set is the ratchet
# on what may STOP being vendor. A bare count floor could not do that job: the
# original vocabulary spanned 33 stems across seven families, so a floor conservative
# enough to survive a deliberate reclassification (the old 15) left roughly
# eighteen headers that could be retagged `mixed(...)`/`peripheral(...)` one at
# a time, each silently un-gating that header for every file above the seam on
# a green run. Pinning the set closes that: a stem listed here that the audit
# no longer tags `vendor(...)` is a blocking EB3-load error naming it.
#
# ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE, and this is the property to keep. Tagging a NEW header
# `vendor(...)` in the audit arms more enforcement and needs no edit here —
# never make arming the ratchet cost a second diff. Only DE-classification is
# gated, because that is the direction that removes enforcement. Removing a
# stem below is therefore the same act as an EB3 baseline re-baseline and takes
# the same evidence: the classification change proven against the merge base,
# the reasoning documented, and explicit maintainer review (docs/agents/backends.md,
# "Engine boundary ratchet — EB3"). Deleting a vendor header outright also lands here —
# drop its stem in that commit.
