"""Raw Flex command-plane ratchet above the seam — #5262 M4.

WHY THIS EXISTS. M4 converts the dual command plane: models still emit Flex wire
text that is SILENTLY DROPPED on HL2/Icom/ANAN/RTL (RadioModel::sendCmd()'s
no-command-plane path), so every unconverted control is a live-looking dead
control on those radios. M0 made that drop loud (#5265: qCWarning + a one-shot
operator notice), which turned the backlog visible — a live IC-7300MK2 connect
dropped 14 SmartSDR commands, each one a conversion site.

M4's first checklist item is this ratchet, and it comes first for a reason: the
conversion is long (hundreds of call sites, by subsystem), and without a floor
under it new controls keep arriving on the old plane faster than old ones leave.

WHAT COUNTS, AND WHY RESOLVING THE RECEIVER IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM.

The obvious matcher — `emit commandReady(` in models, `sendCommand(` in gui —
is wrong in both directions, and the first version of this checker shipped with
exactly that bug (#5619 review):

  * IT UNDER-COUNTS. SliceModel::sendCommand() is a ONE-LINE HELPER whose body
    is `emit commandReady(cmd);`, and ~62 call sites behind it carry raw wire
    text (`slice tune`, `filt %1 %2 %3`, `slice set %1 rxant=`). Counting only
    the literal emit saw 2 — freezing the milestone's LARGEST conversion target
    (#5262 names SliceModel at 60 sites) at a number a new control could grow
    under without tripping anything. A ratchet that reads green while the
    biggest target grows is worse than no ratchet, because the next change
    cites it as coverage.

  * IT OVER-COUNTS. `sendCommand` is not one protocol. AntennaGeniusModel has
    its own method of that name that writes to ITS OWN TCP SOCKET
    (AntennaGeniusModel.cpp:411), and TunerModel reaches a separate device
    through `m_directConn->sendCommand(...)`. Neither is the Flex command plane
    and neither should be frozen here.

So the receiver is resolved explicitly rather than guessed from the directory:

  1. `emit commandReady(` — the plane's own signal. Always counts.
  2. `sendCmd(` — RadioModel's internal sink name. Always counts.
  3. `sendCommand(` — counts UNLESS the receiver is a known foreign device,
     which the two exclusions below name. Helper DEFINITIONS are not call
     sites and are subtracted.

WHERE IT LOOKS. The same above-seam definition check_engine_boundary.py uses
(src/gui + src/core + src/models, plus the src/ root shell files), minus
src/core/backends/ — that is where the wire text is SUPPOSED to live, and M4's
direction is moving encode there. The first version scanned only models and gui,
which missed WfmDemodulator.cpp's two live emissions in src/core/ and made the
"backends/flex is excluded" claim describe an exclusion that did not exist,
since nothing under src/core/ was read at all.

PER-FILE, NOT A TOTAL. A total lets one subsystem's conversion pay for another's
regression; per-file means a converted file cannot quietly refill. A file absent
from the baseline must stay at zero, so a NEW control on the old plane fails
even while the old ones are still being migrated — which is the point.

ANTI-VACUITY. A missing root is an ERROR, not an empty scan. The first version
returned "every file is clear" and exit 0 when run from the wrong directory;
check_engine_boundary.py carries ABOVE_SEAM_DIR_FLOOR for exactly this failure
mode and this now does too.

    python tools/check_command_plane.py --strict   # exit 1 on growth

#
# ALLOW-LIST, NOT DENY-LIST, and the direction is the point (#5619 review, Ozy).

# VK-amplifier poll and DxClusterDialog's telnet `show/dx` as if they were Flex
# wire text, because they were not on it. Allow-listing the RadioModel receivers
# inverts that — a NEW foreign protocol is ignored by default, which is correct,
# and the residual risk becomes under-counting a Flex call made through an
# unfamiliar receiver name. That risk is bounded by the census below, which was
# taken over the whole above-seam tree rather than guessed.
#
# Receivers that ARE the Flex command plane (census of every qualified call):
#     m_radioModel  61x sendCommand + 3x sendCmdPublic

#     this           1x sendCmd

#     client / m_dxCluster (DX cluster + RBN telnet), m_wanConn (SmartLink WAN),
#     m_pgxlConn (PGXL amp), m_directConn (tuner), connection
# Files whose UNQUALIFIED send* calls route to the Flex plane. Everything else
# unqualified belongs to the object that defines it — AntennaGeniusModel writes
# its own QTcpSocket, VkampConnection/TgxlConnection/PgxlConnection/WanConnection

# GENERIC PASSTHROUGH HELPERS: methods that wrap `emit commandReady` AND take the

# text at the call site, so it is a conversion site (#5619 review,
# aethersdr-agent: a new `usb_cable` control slipped through because only
# send(Command|Cmd|CmdPublic) was resolved).
#
# WHY THIS IS HAND-LISTED RATHER THAN DERIVED, which was the review's preferred
# fix. Deriving "every method whose body emits commandReady" finds 64 of them —
# and most are TYPED SETTERS: TransmitModel::setRfPower, setCwSpeed, setVoxEnable
# and ~40 more. Those assemble their own wire text from a typed argument, and a
# call to one is precisely the typed intent M4 is migrating TOWARD. Counting them
# would freeze the destination as if it were the thing being left behind — six
# sampled setters alone are 26 gui call sites.
#
# The property that actually matters is "does the CALLER name the wire key?",
# which no regex can decide:
#     sendCommand(QString cmd)          caller supplies the whole command  -> count
#     sendSet(serial, key, value)       caller supplies the key            -> count
#     setRfPower(int watts)             key is internal                    -> do not
# So the list is curated against that criterion, and the criterion is written
# here so the next addition is a judgement someone can check rather than repeat.
